      "Lord Rama was born in the magnificent city of Ayodhya, which was situated on the banks of the river Sarayu in Kosala Country.

The people living there enjoyed a joyful and satisfied life, thanks to their benevolent ruler, King Dasharatha.\n",

His brothers, Lakshmana, Bharatha, and Shatrugna, stood behind them, supporting their reign. The people of Ayodhya rejoiced at this event, and their happiness knew no bounds as the celebrations continued for an entire week. Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years, ensuring peace and prosperity for his people. [Page 2, Chapter: THE BIRTH OF RAMA]\n",
