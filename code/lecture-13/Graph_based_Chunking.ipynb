The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one')]...\n",

He was very \\nproud of his handsome eldest son and could not bear to be away \\nfrom him even for a moment.'), (2, '3 \\n \\n1.2 The Valiant Princes \\n \\nThe four princes grew up to be strong and handsome. Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful. He wants to take Rama with \\nhim so that your son can learn to fight the Rakshasas even at this \\nyoung age. Send Rama with him.\"  \\n \\nWithout any more hesitation, king Dasharatha blessed Rama and \\nalso Lakshmana who wanted to be with his brother and sent them \\nwith Vishwamitra. \\n \\nVishwamitra and the two princes travelling barefoot first crossed the \\nriver Sarayu and then, the river Ganga. Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama and Ahalya were re-united thus. \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall. The hall wore a grand look and was filled with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\" \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest. \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow. He lifted it up effortlessly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except')]...\n",

He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

The people of the city lived a happy and \\ncontented life as they were ruled by a wonderful king called \\nDasharatha. He cared for his people very deeply. \\n \\nKing Dasahratha had three wives, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. \\nKaushalya was the eldest queen. Though the king loved all his wives  \\ndeeply, it was Kaikeyi, his youngest queen who was his favourite.But \\nin spite of leading such a good life. Dasahratha was still an unhappy \\nman.This was because he had no children. He was getting old and \\nhad no son to ascend to the throne. \\n \\nUnable to see the king being sad, the sages advised him to \\nundertake a yagna and pray for children. Heeding to their advice, he \\nperformed the yagna and pleased with him, Agni, the fire God, \\nemerged out of the fire pit, handed over a cup containing sweetened \\nmilk to the king and told him \"O king! This kheer is the nectar of life. \\nIt was prepared by the gods in heaven. Distribute it among your \\nwives. You will be blessed with sons.\" \\n \\nDasahratha was delighted. He thanked Agni for this boon and in the \\nroyal chamber, gave Kaushalya half of the kheer. He divided the \\nremaining kheer into two portions and gave one portion to Sumitra \\nand the other one to Kaikeyi. \\n \\nSubsequently all the three queens gave birth to sons, Kaushalya \\ngave birth to Rama, after which Bharata was born to Kaikeyi and \\nlater on Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Shatrugna.King \\nDasahratha was very happy and so were the people of Ayodhya.With \\ngreat rejoice, they celebrated the birth of the four princes. \\n \\nDasharatha loved all his sons but Rama was his dearest. He was very \\nproud of his handsome eldest son and could not bear to be away \\nfrom him even for a moment.'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Sumitra with 3 references, [(1, '2 \\n \\n1 RAMAYANA FOR CHILDREN \\n \\n1.1 THE BIRTH OF RAMA \\n \\nAyodhya was a magnificent city on the banks of the river Sarayu in \\nKosala Country .It had wide roads, huge buildings, beautiful parks \\nand glittering shops. The people of the city lived a happy and \\ncontented life as they were ruled by a wonderful king called \\nDasharatha. He cared for his people very deeply. \\n \\nKing Dasahratha had three wives, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. \\nKaushalya was the eldest queen. Though the king loved all his wives  \\ndeeply, it was Kaikeyi, his youngest queen who was his favourite.But \\nin spite of leading such a good life. Dasahratha was still an unhappy \\nman.This was because he had no children. He was getting old and \\nhad no son to ascend to the throne. \\n \\nUnable to see the king being sad, the sages advised him to \\nundertake a yagna and pray for children. Heeding to their advice, he \\nperformed the yagna and pleased with him, Agni, the fire God, \\nemerged out of the fire pit, handed over a cup containing sweetened \\nmilk to the king and told him \"O king! This kheer is the nectar of life. \\nIt was prepared by the gods in heaven. Distribute it among your \\nwives. You will be blessed with sons.\" \\n \\nDasahratha was delighted. He thanked Agni for this boon and in the \\nroyal chamber, gave Kaushalya half of the kheer. He divided the \\nremaining kheer into two portions and gave one portion to Sumitra \\nand the other one to Kaikeyi. \\n \\nSubsequently all the three queens gave birth to sons, Kaushalya \\ngave birth to Rama, after which Bharata was born to Kaikeyi and \\nlater on Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Shatrugna.King \\nDasahratha was very happy and so were the people of Ayodhya.With \\ngreat rejoice, they celebrated the birth of the four princes. \\n \\nDasharatha loved all his sons but Rama was his dearest. He was very \\nproud of his handsome eldest son and could not bear to be away \\nfrom him even for a moment.'), (4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra.

When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra!

Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here.

I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful.

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra!

He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Kaikeyi with 3 references, [(1, '2 \\n \\n1 RAMAYANA FOR CHILDREN \\n \\n1.1 THE BIRTH OF RAMA \\n \\nAyodhya was a magnificent city on the banks of the river Sarayu in \\nKosala Country .It had wide roads, huge buildings, beautiful parks \\nand glittering shops. The people of the city lived a happy and \\ncontented life as they were ruled by a wonderful king called \\nDasharatha. He cared for his people very deeply. \\n \\nKing Dasahratha had three wives, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. \\nKaushalya was the eldest queen. Though the king loved all his wives  \\ndeeply, it was Kaikeyi, his youngest queen who was his favourite.But \\nin spite of leading such a good life. Dasahratha was still an unhappy \\nman.This was because he had no children. He was getting old and \\nhad no son to ascend to the throne. \\n \\nUnable to see the king being sad, the sages advised him to \\nundertake a yagna and pray for children. Heeding to their advice, he \\nperformed the yagna and pleased with him, Agni, the fire God, \\nemerged out of the fire pit, handed over a cup containing sweetened \\nmilk to the king and told him \"O king! This kheer is the nectar of life. \\nIt was prepared by the gods in heaven. Distribute it among your \\nwives. You will be blessed with sons.\" \\n \\nDasahratha was delighted. He thanked Agni for this boon and in the \\nroyal chamber, gave Kaushalya half of the kheer. He divided the \\nremaining kheer into two portions and gave one portion to Sumitra \\nand the other one to Kaikeyi. \\n \\nSubsequently all the three queens gave birth to sons, Kaushalya \\ngave birth to Rama, after which Bharata was born to Kaikeyi and \\nlater on Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Shatrugna.King \\nDasahratha was very happy and so were the people of Ayodhya.With \\ngreat rejoice, they celebrated the birth of the four princes. \\n \\nDasharatha loved all his sons but Rama was his dearest. He was very \\nproud of his handsome eldest son and could not bear to be away \\nfrom him even for a moment.'), (4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka.

Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone.

The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Siva with 2 references, [(2, '3 \\n \\n1.2 The Valiant Princes \\n \\nThe four princes grew up to be strong and handsome. Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful. He wants to take Rama with \\nhim so that your son can learn to fight the Rakshasas even at this \\nyoung age. Send Rama with him.\"  \\n \\nWithout any more hesitation, king Dasharatha blessed Rama and \\nalso Lakshmana who wanted to be with his brother and sent them \\nwith Vishwamitra. \\n \\nVishwamitra and the two princes travelling barefoot first crossed the \\nriver Sarayu and then, the river Ganga. Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama and Ahalya were re-united thus. \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall. The hall wore a grand look and was filled with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\" \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest. \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow. He lifted it up effortlessly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except'), (3, '6 \\n \\nfor Rama, Lakshmana and Vishwamitra, everybody else turned pale. \\nRam, a lifted the entire bow like a toy and broke it into two. King \\nJanaka was extremely happy that Rama, the eldest prince of \\nAyodhya was to wed his daughter Sita.  \\n \\nOn Vishwamitra advice, Janaka sent messengers to Ayodhya to \\nconvey this happy news to Dasharatha. Rama, Lakshmana and Rishi \\nVishwamitra are now in Mithila after successfully completing yagna. \\nSri Rama has gained the hand of my daughter Sita in marriage by \\nlifting the Siva bow. I am therefore inviting you and your family to \\ncome to Mithila and accept Sita as your daughter-in-law\" was the \\nmessage sent by Janaka. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha was delighted to hear this news and reached \\nMithila along with his wives, his ministers, Sage Vashishta and \\nothers to take part in the wedding. \\n \\nWhile Rama wed Sita, Uremia was married to Lakshmana and \\nJanaka\\'s nieces Mondovi and Shruakirthi to Bharata and Shatrugna. \\n \\nThese weddings were performed on a very grand scale. Dasharatha \\ndonated cows in the name of each of his sons and not to be outdone; \\nKling Janaka made cash presents to all the Brahmins. A grand feast \\nhad been arranged for all the citizens. The newly wed couples were \\nblessed by one and all. \\n \\nSita was a devout wife who always stood by her husband. The \\nextremely beautiful Sita made an ideal couple. \\n \\nThe day after wedding, Vishwamitra returned to his Ashram \\n(hermitage). Dasahratha with his sons and daughters-in-law, along \\nwith his entourage left for Ayodhya. Half-way through their journey, \\na severe storm broke out. The entire atmosphere was filled with dust \\nand was enveloped in darkness. At that time, a Rishi by name \\nParushurama appeared before them. His face was full of rage. He \\nalso had an enormous bow with him. His awesome appearance \\nproclaimed that he was no ordinary rishi. He was the mighty \\nParushurama who had conquered several Kshatriyas and had \\nvoyaged round the earth twenty-one times. \\n \\nParushurama went straight to Rama, and said in a sarcastic voice \\n\"Rama, I heard that breaking the Siva bow was a very easy for you. \\nI have a bigger and mightier bow. Let us see whether you can string \\n\\n7 \\n \\nit”. Dasahratha who was watching Parushurama, came running to \\nhim and prayed to him \"Parushurama, please calm down. My \\nchildren have not done any harm to you. Bless them. Spare Rama\". \\nParushurama ignored Dasharatha’s plea. >He taunted Rama again \\nand again. \\n \\nSmiling gently at this, Rama picked up the bow very easily and fixed \\nthe arrow to it. He then asked Parushurama \"Sir, you are a Brahmin \\nand it would be improper for me to use the arrow on you.

The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful. He wants to take Rama with \\nhim so that your son can learn to fight the Rakshasas even at this \\nyoung age. Send Rama with him.\"  \\n \\nWithout any more hesitation, king Dasharatha blessed Rama and \\nalso Lakshmana who wanted to be with his brother and sent them \\nwith Vishwamitra. \\n \\nVishwamitra and the two princes travelling barefoot first crossed the \\nriver Sarayu and then, the river Ganga. Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama and Ahalya were re-united thus. \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall. The hall wore a grand look and was filled with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\" \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest. \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow. He lifted it up effortlessly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except'), (4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili.

When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama and Ahalya were re-united thus. \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall. The hall wore a grand look and was filled with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\" \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest. \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow.

Happy and contented, \\nRama decided to spend the night there.* \\n \\nRama smiled and replied \"Surpanaka, I am already married. Do you \\nsee the beautiful lady over there? She is my wife Sita. As I told you \\nearlier, this is my brother Lakshmana. He is married but has left his \\nwife behind. I suggest you propose him.\" \\n \\nSurpanaka thought it would be a good idea and went to Lakshmana \\n\"O Lakshmana, did you hear about what your brother said? Come, let \\nus get married and lead a happy life.\" \\n \\nLakshmana said jokingly \"My dear lady, I am a humble servant of \\nRama. If you marry me, you will have to be a maid here. Rama will \\nbe a king in few years. It\\'s best if you marry him. You can then be \\nthe queen\". \\n \\nSurpanaka pestered Rama again. \"Rama, marry me. otherwise I will \\ngobble up Sita and then force you to marry me.\" \\n \\nRama refused and the angry Surpanaka tried to attack Sita. But \\nLakshmana quickly drew out his sword and cut off her ears and \\nnose. \\n \\nScreaming with pain and rage, Surpanaka ran to her brother Khara \\nand told him about how Rama and Lakshmana ill-treated her. \"I \\nwant to drink Sita\\'s blood. I also want the severed heads of Rama \\nand Lakshmana. My dear brother, please fulfill my wish\" she said. \\n \\nKhara who was infuriated on seeing the condition of his dear sister \\nordered fourteen of his fellow-demons to kill Rama and Lakshmana. \\nBut Rama knocked them down. Within moments, all of them were \\ndead. \\n \\nKhara then took a large army of Rakshasas with him and promised \\nhis sister that he would gift her Rama\\'s head. Each of the Rakshasas \\nof the army charged menacingly towards Rama. Rama fought against \\nthem single-handed while Lakshmana stood guard near Sita. Rama \\ndestroyed the entire army and soon killed Khara and Dushana also. \\nThe Rishis and the suras who were watching this battle showered \\npetals on Rama and hailed his victory over the demons. They were \\ngrateful to Rama for bringing peace to Dandakaranya. Sita was very \\nhappy that Rama fought valiantly against the powerful Khara and \\n\\n22 \\n \\nDushana. So did Lakshmana. \\n \\nSurpanaka who also witnessed the mighty power of Rama fled to \\nLanka. When she reached the court of Ravana, he was conducting a \\nmeeting with his ministers about an important matter relating to \\nLanka. Surpanaka entered the court in a dramatic way, crying loudly \\nand trying to cover her gaping nose with her hand. Ravana was \\nhorrified to see his sister in such condition. \\n \\nEven before he could say anything Surpanaka burst out talking \\n\"Ravana, my brother! All the Rakshasas have been killed. Khara and \\nDushana are dead. And imagine! just one human being is responsible \\nfor all this disaster. A man by name Rama has killed fourteen \\nthousand Rakshasas and also Khara and Dushana. Rama is no \\nordinary person. When he uses his arrows, it appears as though \\nthere is a rain of arrows. And here you are leading a life of luxury, \\nnot caring about your brothers who died at the hands of Rama.\"* \\n  \\nHe described to Maricha the way in which Surpanaka was disfigured \\nand how Khara and met a cruel death. “I have to take revenge \\nagainst Rama. Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.')]...\n",

He lifted it up effortlessly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except'), (5, '21 \\n \\nA thatched hut was specially erected for them. Happy and contented, \\nRama decided to spend the night there.* \\n \\nRama smiled and replied \"Surpanaka, I am already married. Do you \\nsee the beautiful lady over there? She is my wife Sita. As I told you \\nearlier, this is my brother Lakshmana. He is married but has left his \\nwife behind. I suggest you propose him.\" \\n \\nSurpanaka thought it would be a good idea and went to Lakshmana \\n\"O Lakshmana, did you hear about what your brother said? Come, let \\nus get married and lead a happy life.\" \\n \\nLakshmana said jokingly \"My dear lady, I am a humble servant of \\nRama. If you marry me, you will have to be a maid here. Rama will \\nbe a king in few years. It\\'s best if you marry him. You can then be \\nthe queen\". \\n \\nSurpanaka pestered Rama again. \"Rama, marry me. otherwise I will \\ngobble up Sita and then force you to marry me.\" \\n \\nRama refused and the angry Surpanaka tried to attack Sita. But \\nLakshmana quickly drew out his sword and cut off her ears and \\nnose. \\n \\nScreaming with pain and rage, Surpanaka ran to her brother Khara \\nand told him about how Rama and Lakshmana ill-treated her. \"I \\nwant to drink Sita\\'s blood. I also want the severed heads of Rama \\nand Lakshmana. My dear brother, please fulfill my wish\" she said. \\n \\nKhara who was infuriated on seeing the condition of his dear sister \\nordered fourteen of his fellow-demons to kill Rama and Lakshmana. \\nBut Rama knocked them down. Within moments, all of them were \\ndead. \\n \\nKhara then took a large army of Rakshasas with him and promised \\nhis sister that he would gift her Rama\\'s head. Each of the Rakshasas \\nof the army charged menacingly towards Rama. Rama fought against \\nthem single-handed while Lakshmana stood guard near Sita. Rama \\ndestroyed the entire army and soon killed Khara and Dushana also. \\nThe Rishis and the suras who were watching this battle showered \\npetals on Rama and hailed his victory over the demons. They were \\ngrateful to Rama for bringing peace to Dandakaranya. Sita was very \\nhappy that Rama fought valiantly against the powerful Khara and \\n\\n22 \\n \\nDushana. So did Lakshmana. \\n \\nSurpanaka who also witnessed the mighty power of Rama fled to \\nLanka. When she reached the court of Ravana, he was conducting a \\nmeeting with his ministers about an important matter relating to \\nLanka. Surpanaka entered the court in a dramatic way, crying loudly \\nand trying to cover her gaping nose with her hand. Ravana was \\nhorrified to see his sister in such condition. \\n \\nEven before he could say anything Surpanaka burst out talking \\n\"Ravana, my brother! All the Rakshasas have been killed. Khara and \\nDushana are dead. And imagine! just one human being is responsible \\nfor all this disaster. A man by name Rama has killed fourteen \\nthousand Rakshasas and also Khara and Dushana. Rama is no \\nordinary person. When he uses his arrows, it appears as though \\nthere is a rain of arrows. And here you are leading a life of luxury, \\nnot caring about your brothers who died at the hands of Rama.\"* \\n  \\nHe described to Maricha the way in which Surpanaka was disfigured \\nand how Khara and met a cruel death. “I have to take revenge \\nagainst Rama. Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.')]...\n",

So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki.

They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha!

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna.

When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow.

Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra!

For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow.

It dawned upon \\nhim that Rama was no ordinary person. He bowed his head and \\nsaid\"Rama, I am no match for you. Hence this mighty bow belongs \\nto you\". He then departed for the Himalayas to continue his penance. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt relieved; he then continued his journey towards \\nAyodhya. \\n \\nAt Ayodhya, a grand reception awaited the newlyweds, for many \\ndays, this happy event was celebrated with pomp and pageantry. \\nDasharatha was very happy that his sons, especially Rama, were \\nloved so much by the citizens of Ayodhya. \\n \\n1.4 KAIKEYI AND HER WISHES \\n \\nSoon after Rama\\'s marriage with Sita, king Dasharatha wanted to \\ncrown him the king as himself was getting older.

They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful.

Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life.

The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

Under sage \\nVashistha\\'s guidance, they excelled themselves in archery, riding \\nand hunting. They also learnt about the holy books and how to look \\nafter the welfare of the people. They respected their Gurus and the \\nelders and gained the love and affection of people of Ayodhya. \\nThe brothers loved each other very much too. Lakshmana was a very \\nclose companion to Rama.Bharatha and Shatrugna were the other \\ntwo inseparables. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt very proud of his sons. One day he was \\ndiscussing with sage Vashishta about finding suitable brides for his \\nsons. At that time a great sage called Vishwamitra came to the court \\nof Dasharatha. The king was very happy to welcome him Ayodhya. \\nAfter extending a warm hospitality he asked Vishwamitra \"O great \\nsage! Your visit has made me a very happy. Pray, tell me the \\npurpose of your visit. I shall deem it a great honour to abide by your \\nwish.\" \\n \\nVishwamitra, pleased with the king\\'s words told him \"King \\nDasharatha! I am pleased with your hospitality. I have heard that \\nyou always keep up your word. That\\'s why I am here. I about to \\nperform a yagna but two Rakshasas, Mareecha and Subahu, pour \\nblood and human flesh on the fire pit and pollute the Yagna. I cannot \\ncast any curse on them as I am involved in sacred work. But I \\ncannot perform the yagna till these demons are killed.Rama, your \\nson, is the only valiant person who can kill them. Hence, please send \\nhim with me for ten days. As soon as the yagna is completed, I will \\nsend back Rama to Ayodhya.\"  \\n \\nWhen aged king heard this request, he felt nervous about sending \\nhis young son to fight against the demons. “Respect Sage\", \\nHe pleaded with Vishwamitra, \"My dear son Rama is still very young. \\nHow can he fight against the Rakshass? Instead of Rama, I will send \\nmy entire army to help you in conducting yagna. I cannot bear to be \\nseparated from Rama and hence please spare me this agony.\" \\nVishwamitra was angry at Dasharatha\\'s words.\"O king, you are \\ngoing back on your word. I do not want anybody except Rama\". So \\nsaying, he decided to walk out of the court. At this juncture, \\nVashishta pacified him and told Dasharatha. “Do not hesitate to send \\nRama. It is not a difficult task for Vishwamitra to kill the Rakshasas \\n\\n4 \\n \\nbecause he himself is very powerful. He wants to take Rama with \\nhim so that your son can learn to fight the Rakshasas even at this \\nyoung age. Send Rama with him.\"  \\n \\nWithout any more hesitation, king Dasharatha blessed Rama and \\nalso Lakshmana who wanted to be with his brother and sent them \\nwith Vishwamitra. \\n \\nVishwamitra and the two princes travelling barefoot first crossed the \\nriver Sarayu and then, the river Ganga. Rama and Lakshmana did not \\nmind the hardship at all, as this was their chance to learn about \\nmany things from Vishwamitra. After many days of walking, they \\nentered a thick forest where a rakshasi called Taraka lived. She had \\nterrorized all the sages in the forest and hence Vishwamitra \\ninstructed Rama to kill her. \\n \\nRama drew out his arrow and aimed it at Taraka. The ugly looking \\ndemoness charged towards him but was killed by Rama\\'s arrow. \\nVishwamitra was very pleased with Rama and gifted him many \\npowerful weapons. Rama accepted them gracefully and learnt from \\nVishwamitra about their use. \\n \\nThe trio continued their journey and reached the spot where \\nVishwamitra was to perform the yagna. The Rishis of the Ashram \\nwere happy to have Rama in their midst. The princess rested for the \\nnight and from the next morning protected the yagna against the \\nRakshasas. Everything went on smoothly till the last day. \\n \\nOn the last day of the yagna, suddenly, piece of flesh and blood fell \\ninto the sacred fire. When Rama looked up, he saw Mareecha and \\nSubahu. The weapons were so strong and powerful that Mareecha \\nwas thrown into the sea hundreds of miles away while Subahu was \\nengulfed in a ball of fire. All the Rishis were relieved that these evil \\ndemons were destroyed by Rama and joyously completed the Yagna. \\nAfter conducting the yagna, Vishwamitra and the other Rishis left for \\nthe city of Maithili. Rama and Lakshmana accompanied them. \\nThis city was ruled by Janaka, loved and respected for his goodness. \\nHe had a daughter by name Sita. Janaka had found her in a ploughed \\nfield and had reared her as his own daughter. Sita was the loveliest \\nprincess and was also renowned for her strength of character. When \\nshe was of the marriageable age, Janaka had announced that \\nwhoever could string the Siva bow would wed her. This bow was not \\nan ordinary bow. It was so huge that five thousand people were \\n\\n5 \\n \\nneeded to lug it. Sage Vishwamitra knew about this bow and had \\npurposely taken the young princes to Mithila. \\n \\nOn their way to Mithila, they halted at an Ashram where Gautama, a \\nsage, had once lived. Gautama had a wife called Ahalya who was \\nextremely beautiful. Indra, the king of the heavens, desired her and \\nin Gautama\\'s absence, made love to her. The enraged Gautama cast \\na curse on Indra. He also cursed Ahalya \"As you have cheated me, \\nmay you turn into a stone. You will be rid of this curse only when Sri \\nRama touches you\" so saying, Gautama had gone away to the \\nHimalayas to observe penance. \\n \\nVishwamitra narrated Ahalya’s tragic story to Rama and instructed \\nhim \"Ramachandra! Rescue Ahalya from this curse and give her a \\nnew life.\" \\n \\nRama followed this advice and as soon as he touched the stone \\nstatue, Ahalya came to life. At that moment Gautama also returned \\nto the ashram. Gautama and Ahalya were re-united thus. \\n \\n1.3 SITA\\'S SWAYAMVAR \\n \\nVishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana reached Mithila in time for Sita\\'s \\nswamyamvar: As per Janaka\\'s wish, the mighty Siva bow was hauled \\nto the wedding hall. The hall wore a grand look and was filled with \\nmany kings and princes. Ravana, the king of Lanka was also present \\nand was confident that he could win Sita\\'s hand easily. For, Janaka \\nhad announced that to win Sita\\'s hand in marriage, any king or \\nprince had to lift the bow and string it. Many tried, but failed. Even \\nRavana fell down while trying to lift the bow and had hurriedly \\ndisappeared from the hall out of shame. Vishwamitra turned towards \\nRama and told him gently \"Son1 I am sure you are keen to examine \\nthe bow. Why don\\'t you lift it and see how heavy it is?\" \\n \\nKing Janaka was quite doubtful whether a young person like Rama \\nwould be able to achieve where the others had failed. But he felt \\nvery impressed by Rama\\'s noble looks and hence allowed Rama to \\ncontest. \\n \\nRama bowed before Vishwamitra to seek his blessings and walked \\nup to the mighty Siva bow. He lifted it up effortlessly and stringed it. \\nThe entire hall echoed with the sound of bow being stringed. Except'), (9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one')]...\n",

Hence \\nplease tell me, at what do I aim the arrow at\". \\n \\nParushurama was stunned with Ramas’s mastery over the weapon. \\nHe could not even say anything. He gazed at Rama. It dawned upon \\nhim that Rama was no ordinary person. He bowed his head and \\nsaid\"Rama, I am no match for you. Hence this mighty bow belongs \\nto you\". He then departed for the Himalayas to continue his penance. \\n \\nKing Dasharatha felt relieved; he then continued his journey towards \\nAyodhya. \\n \\nAt Ayodhya, a grand reception awaited the newlyweds, for many \\ndays, this happy event was celebrated with pomp and pageantry. \\nDasharatha was very happy that his sons, especially Rama, were \\nloved so much by the citizens of Ayodhya. \\n \\n1.4 KAIKEYI AND HER WISHES \\n \\nSoon after Rama\\'s marriage with Sita, king Dasharatha wanted to \\ncrown him the king as himself was getting older. Dasharatha \\ntherefore consulted his ministers about this. All of them \\nwholeheartedly welcomed this decision. Dasharatha felt very happy \\nand enthusiastic. He looked forwarded to the coronation of Rama. He \\ntherefore immediately made announcements to this effect. He \\ninvited all the important people of Ayodhya and told them \"I have \\ndecided to crown my eldest son Rama. This is my ardent desire. If all \\nof you agree .I will go ahead with the arrangements.\" Everybody \\nwas delighted. The people of Ayodhya rejoiced that Rama was to be \\ntheir king. \\n \\nHectic preparations were on. Singers, dancers and other artists were'), (4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Parushurama with 1 references, [(3, '6 \\n \\nfor Rama, Lakshmana and Vishwamitra, everybody else turned pale. \\nRam, a lifted the entire bow like a toy and broke it into two. King \\nJanaka was extremely happy that Rama, the eldest prince of \\nAyodhya was to wed his daughter Sita.  \\n \\nOn Vishwamitra advice, Janaka sent messengers to Ayodhya to \\nconvey this happy news to Dasharatha.

Rama went to the Godavari bank but \\ncould not find her there.  \\nRama was heart-broken. Life seemed meaningless without Sita. With \\ntears rolling down his cheeks, he recalled the way in which Sita \\nwould stroll in the garden, how happy she was in Panchavati and so \\non. At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone. Lakshmana tried to explain to Rama about how reluctant he \\nwas to leave Sita insisted that he go in search of Rama. \\nBut this did not console Rama in any way. He roamed through the \\nforests like a madman, calling out her name so often, talking to \\nplants and animals about Sita.

Please kill Ravana, free Sita and lead a happy life.” He \\ndied in Rama’s arms, contented that he had the good fortune or \\nrendering some service to Rama. \\nRama perfumed Jatayu’s last rites as a son would do for his father. \\nThen Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey westwards. \\nOn third way, they were stopped by a cruel looking Rakshasa. He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven. Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend. He will help you to \\nknow the whereabouts Sita. \\nSo the two brothers proceeded towards Rishyamukha. Tired and \\nhungry, they noticed an Ashram. Sabari, a Sanyasini lived here.

Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",

The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Parnakuti with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Dashratha with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Welcoming Rama with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Kaushalaya with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on.

He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them.

Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Sumantra with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Tamasa with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Sowmitri with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: kingdom with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Yamuna with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Bharadwaj with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Manthara with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Kosala with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Asuras with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Please with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on.

She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them.

You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Guha with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Raghu with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Sumanthara with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: King Dasharatha with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Enraged with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Chitrakut with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Dandakaranya with 2 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.'), (5, '21 \\n \\nA thatched hut was specially erected for them. Happy and contented, \\nRama decided to spend the night there.* \\n \\nRama smiled and replied \"Surpanaka, I am already married. Do you \\nsee the beautiful lady over there? She is my wife Sita. As I told you \\nearlier, this is my brother Lakshmana. He is married but has left his \\nwife behind. I suggest you propose him.\" \\n \\nSurpanaka thought it would be a good idea and went to Lakshmana \\n\"O Lakshmana, did you hear about what your brother said? Come, let \\nus get married and lead a happy life.\" \\n \\nLakshmana said jokingly \"My dear lady, I am a humble servant of \\nRama. If you marry me, you will have to be a maid here. Rama will \\nbe a king in few years. It\\'s best if you marry him. You can then be \\nthe queen\". \\n \\nSurpanaka pestered Rama again. \"Rama, marry me. otherwise I will \\ngobble up Sita and then force you to marry me.\" \\n \\nRama refused and the angry Surpanaka tried to attack Sita. But \\nLakshmana quickly drew out his sword and cut off her ears and \\nnose. \\n \\nScreaming with pain and rage, Surpanaka ran to her brother Khara \\nand told him about how Rama and Lakshmana ill-treated her. \"I \\nwant to drink Sita\\'s blood. I also want the severed heads of Rama \\nand Lakshmana. My dear brother, please fulfill my wish\" she said. \\n \\nKhara who was infuriated on seeing the condition of his dear sister \\nordered fourteen of his fellow-demons to kill Rama and Lakshmana. \\nBut Rama knocked them down. Within moments, all of them were \\ndead. \\n \\nKhara then took a large army of Rakshasas with him and promised \\nhis sister that he would gift her Rama\\'s head. Each of the Rakshasas \\nof the army charged menacingly towards Rama. Rama fought against \\nthem single-handed while Lakshmana stood guard near Sita. Rama \\ndestroyed the entire army and soon killed Khara and Dushana also. \\nThe Rishis and the suras who were watching this battle showered \\npetals on Rama and hailed his victory over the demons. They were \\ngrateful to Rama for bringing peace to Dandakaranya. Sita was very \\nhappy that Rama fought valiantly against the powerful Khara and \\n\\n22 \\n \\nDushana. So did Lakshmana. \\n \\nSurpanaka who also witnessed the mighty power of Rama fled to \\nLanka. When she reached the court of Ravana, he was conducting a \\nmeeting with his ministers about an important matter relating to \\nLanka. Surpanaka entered the court in a dramatic way, crying loudly \\nand trying to cover her gaping nose with her hand. Ravana was \\nhorrified to see his sister in such condition. \\n \\nEven before he could say anything Surpanaka burst out talking \\n\"Ravana, my brother! All the Rakshasas have been killed. Khara and \\nDushana are dead. And imagine! just one human being is responsible \\nfor all this disaster. A man by name Rama has killed fourteen \\nthousand Rakshasas and also Khara and Dushana. Rama is no \\nordinary person. When he uses his arrows, it appears as though \\nthere is a rain of arrows. And here you are leading a life of luxury, \\nnot caring about your brothers who died at the hands of Rama.\"* \\n  \\nHe described to Maricha the way in which Surpanaka was disfigured \\nand how Khara and met a cruel death. “I have to take revenge \\nagainst Rama. Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Kaika with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Utterly with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Janaki with 2 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages. Dandakaranya was one such forest. \\nWhen Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered this forest, the Rishis \\nwelcomed them, offered them fruits and nuts.'), (5, '21 \\n \\nA thatched hut was specially erected for them. Happy and contented, \\nRama decided to spend the night there.* \\n \\nRama smiled and replied \"Surpanaka, I am already married. Do you \\nsee the beautiful lady over there? She is my wife Sita. As I told you \\nearlier, this is my brother Lakshmana. He is married but has left his \\nwife behind. I suggest you propose him.\" \\n \\nSurpanaka thought it would be a good idea and went to Lakshmana \\n\"O Lakshmana, did you hear about what your brother said? Come, let \\nus get married and lead a happy life.\" \\n \\nLakshmana said jokingly \"My dear lady, I am a humble servant of \\nRama. If you marry me, you will have to be a maid here. Rama will \\nbe a king in few years. It\\'s best if you marry him. You can then be \\nthe queen\". \\n \\nSurpanaka pestered Rama again. \"Rama, marry me. otherwise I will \\ngobble up Sita and then force you to marry me.\" \\n \\nRama refused and the angry Surpanaka tried to attack Sita. But \\nLakshmana quickly drew out his sword and cut off her ears and \\nnose. \\n \\nScreaming with pain and rage, Surpanaka ran to her brother Khara \\nand told him about how Rama and Lakshmana ill-treated her. \"I \\nwant to drink Sita\\'s blood. I also want the severed heads of Rama \\nand Lakshmana. My dear brother, please fulfill my wish\" she said. \\n \\nKhara who was infuriated on seeing the condition of his dear sister \\nordered fourteen of his fellow-demons to kill Rama and Lakshmana. \\nBut Rama knocked them down. Within moments, all of them were \\ndead. \\n \\nKhara then took a large army of Rakshasas with him and promised \\nhis sister that he would gift her Rama\\'s head. Each of the Rakshasas \\nof the army charged menacingly towards Rama. Rama fought against \\nthem single-handed while Lakshmana stood guard near Sita. Rama \\ndestroyed the entire army and soon killed Khara and Dushana also. \\nThe Rishis and the suras who were watching this battle showered \\npetals on Rama and hailed his victory over the demons. They were \\ngrateful to Rama for bringing peace to Dandakaranya. Sita was very \\nhappy that Rama fought valiantly against the powerful Khara and \\n\\n22 \\n \\nDushana. So did Lakshmana. \\n \\nSurpanaka who also witnessed the mighty power of Rama fled to \\nLanka. When she reached the court of Ravana, he was conducting a \\nmeeting with his ministers about an important matter relating to \\nLanka. Surpanaka entered the court in a dramatic way, crying loudly \\nand trying to cover her gaping nose with her hand. Ravana was \\nhorrified to see his sister in such condition. \\n \\nEven before he could say anything Surpanaka burst out talking \\n\"Ravana, my brother! All the Rakshasas have been killed. Khara and \\nDushana are dead. And imagine! just one human being is responsible \\nfor all this disaster. A man by name Rama has killed fourteen \\nthousand Rakshasas and also Khara and Dushana. Rama is no \\nordinary person. When he uses his arrows, it appears as though \\nthere is a rain of arrows. And here you are leading a life of luxury, \\nnot caring about your brothers who died at the hands of Rama.\"* \\n  \\nHe described to Maricha the way in which Surpanaka was disfigured \\nand how Khara and met a cruel death. “I have to take revenge \\nagainst Rama. Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: King Dasahratha with 1 references, [(4, '8 \\n \\ninvited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \\nof the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \\nwhile these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \\nRama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \\nking should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \\none with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha\\'s \\nadvice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \\n \\nKaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \\nshortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \\nconveyed this good news to her.  \\n \\nAt the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \\nand Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \\nmother was also happy to hear the news.  \\n  \\nWhen this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \\nto be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \\n“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \\nBharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \\nking, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \\nbe her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \\nsupposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \\nit? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \\n“Just think about the future.” \\n“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \\nRama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \\nthoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \\nSo do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \\nManthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \\nKaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \\nI can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \\nimagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \\n.He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \\naway from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \\npuppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \\nyou will be sending Bharatha to exile. \\n\\n9 \\n \\nProvoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \\ndid not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \\nDasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \\nSo she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \\nwe prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \\nManthara, “Send him to the forest.” \\n“But how?” \\n“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \\nwishes when you saved him in the war against devas and Asuras? \\nAsk them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \\nTo talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \\nAnd demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \\nRama to the forest for 14 years” \\nKaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \\nthat she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \\nRama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \\nBharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \\nall the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \\nthrew them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \\nThe old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \\nher about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \\nupset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \\nwhen he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \\nwiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \\nangry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \\nKaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \\ndue to me long ago?” she asked. \\nHave no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \\nkeep up my word.” \\nFeeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \\nshould be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should \\n\\n10 \\n \\nlive in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \\nwishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \\nKing Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \\nthat Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \\non me “he asked her? \\n“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \\nThe king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \\nconsciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \\nWhat you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \\nlove Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \\nand when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \\nyou. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \\nbear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \\nmy old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \\nplease do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \\ncould not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \\nKaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \\nshe felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \\nrespect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \\nyour word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \\nas a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \\ntime. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \\nKaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \\nthis? \\nTormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \\nKaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \\ncoronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \\nyou. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \\nthis. \\nKaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \\nchamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \\nmorning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \\ngetting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \\nother sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was \\n\\n11 \\n \\ntold that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \\nfind the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \\nking and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \\ntalk to him.” \\nSumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \\nKaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \\ncould not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \\nRama!” \\n“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \\ncaused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \\nKaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \\nreluctance to agree to them. \\nWithout any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \\n“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \\nwill do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \\nbrother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \\nsacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \\ncalm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \\nfather unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \\nAyodhya at once.” \\nKaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \\n“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \\nAyodhya. \\nOn hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \\nbe so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \\nRama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \\nfather, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \\nturned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \\ntell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \\nin salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \\nKaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \\nI live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \\nLakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing \\n\\n12 \\n \\nRama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \\nwipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \\nRama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \\nhis father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \\nRama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\\nstraw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \\nwith a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \\nAfter taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \\nas she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \\nlive in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \\nprevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \\nback in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \\nwell. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \\nAyodhya. No harm will come to me”. \\nSita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \\ncomforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \\nhappiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \\nher “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \\nbed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \\nwill hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \\nSita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \\nwhen you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \\nbed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \\nyou” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \\nLakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \\nrunning to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \\ndo not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \\nAyodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \\nthere was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \\nof them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \\nexile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \\n“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \\nafter our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \\nwill look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \\nthe forest. \\n\\n13 \\n \\nI can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \\nsister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \\nher. \\nSita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \\nRama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \\narrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \\nAyodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \\ntheir king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \\nthought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \\nforest” was their worry.  \\nAs Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \\noffer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \\nanguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \\nthan witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \\nsaid Dasharatha. \\nRama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \\nfulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \\nDasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \\nnor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \\ntrembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \\nand servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \\nangrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \\nyou want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \\ngo with Rama” she said in a final tone. \\nUtterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \\nbe taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \\nto see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \\ndid not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \\nSri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \\ntheir blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \\nthe entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \\nso foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \\nseparation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces. \\n\\n14 \\n \\nThe chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \\nlast look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \\nfaster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \\nKaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \\nas they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \\nfilled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \\nthe street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \\ntouch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \\nEven when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \\nRama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \\naffection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \\nPlease show him the same love and affection that you have towards \\nme”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \\nBy that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \\nthey had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \\ntired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \\nRama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \\ncountry and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \\nthe banks of the river Ganga. \\nWhen the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \\noption than to return to Ayodhya. \\nRama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \\nIn the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \\nof Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \\nSita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \\nRama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \\nonly eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \\nhard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \\nmorning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \\ncare of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \\nAyodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \\nGuha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \\nfront, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \\nwalked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \\nthe thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way \\n\\n15 \\n \\nhuge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \\nthey slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \\njourney again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \\nSage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \\nhospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \\nregion, which was full of enchanting scenery. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \\nChitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \\nRama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \\nasked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \\nperformed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \\nhome. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \\nwere found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \\naround. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \\narea. Sita loved the place. \\nIn the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \\nhad received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \\nChitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \\nghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \\nthey saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \\nSumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \\n“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \\nkingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \\nbirth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \\nwonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \\nThen, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \\nwas young. \\nDasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \\nwas a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \\nthought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \\narrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \\nDasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \\na young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \\nhis blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by \\n\\n16 \\n \\nthe time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \\nThe grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \\nKing! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \\ngrief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \\nyour son. \\nDasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \\nhands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \\nfor all my sins”.  \\nThe king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \\nwith tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \\nme when I die. Kaikeyi has destroyed even this. She is my true \\nenemy. Kaushalya! Sumitra! I do not want to live longer. My eyes are \\nfalling. Rama, my son! Rama, my son!” The king died. \\nAyodhya which was still grieving over Rama’s exile was plunged into \\nsorrow as the news of the king’s death spread. “But what a tragedy? \\nThe king who had four mighty sons died when none of them were \\nnear him. Who will perform his funeral rites” debated the people. \\nSage Vashishta therefore made arrangements for the body to be \\npreserved for a long time. \\nDasharatha’s ministers hurriedly called a meeting and on Vashistha’s \\nadvice, sent word to Bharatha who was visiting his maternal \\nrelatives. But the messengers were instructed not to disclose to \\nBharatha about Rama’s exile and king’s death. \\nOn reaching the message, Bharatha immediately hurried to Ayodhya. \\nJust the previous night, he had some evil omens and he was anxious \\nto return home at the earliest. \\nOn reaching Ayodhya, Bharatha was shocked to see people huddled \\nin corners and weeping. No prayers were offered. No chanting of \\nVedas could be heard. Even one child could not found playing in the \\npark. There was a deathly silence everywhere. The worried Bharatha \\nfirst went to his father’s chambers but found empty. So he went to \\nKaikeyi’s chambers hoping to find his father there, but only Kaikeyi \\nwas there. “Mother, where is my father? What has happened in my \\nabsence” he asked. \\n\\n17 \\n \\nKaikeyi thought that Bharatha would be very pleased to hear that \\nshe had got him the kingdom of Ayodhya. In a gentle tone she said \\n“Son1 Nobody can prevent death. Your father passed away “. \\nShocked by this news, Bharatha collapsed. The death of his father, \\nwhom he loved so dearly, brought tears to his eyes. “I wish I was \\nwith my father when he died” he thought, “At least Rama and \\nLakshmana have had that great honour” he said aloud. “Mother, I \\nhave to go and see Rama and find out if my father had any last \\nmessage for me.” \\nKaikeyi stopped him from leaving and said “Son, wait, your father \\ncried out only for Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. He said he could not \\nlive without them.” \\nBharatha felt that there was more bad news. “Why, mother? Isn’t \\nRama in Ayodhya? Where has he gone? \\nKaikeyi then had to tell him everything. Placing her hand over his \\nhead, she said, “Bharatha, your brother Rama along with Sita and \\nLakshmana are now living in a forest. I have got you the kingdom of \\nAyodhya.” \\nBharatha was stunned to hear this, Enraged, he told his mother, and \\n“I am ashamed to call you as my mother. You are nothing but evil. \\nHow could you banish Rama to the forest?  \\nHadn’t you loved him more than you loved me? Alas! You have killed \\nmy father, just to make me the king. And do you expect me to wear \\nthe crown that rightfully belongs to Rama? Shame on you!” \\nFull of scorn and anger towards his mother, Bharatha decided to \\natone for her sins. “I will go to the forest and live there for the rest \\nof my life. But before that, I will bring back Rama and make him the \\nking.” \\nHe then went to Kaushalya and sobbing bitterly; he fell at her feet \\nand said ‘Mother, I am the sinner. I have been the cause of my \\nfather’s death and my brothers’ exile to the forest. Will your ever \\nforgive me and my own mother?” Kaushalya consoled him that none \\ncan change the course of destiny. She knew of his pure mind. \\n\\n18 \\n \\nBharatha met the ministers. He offered his salutations to Sage \\nVashishta. On seeing Bharatha, Vashishta made arrangements for \\nthe funeral of Dasharatha. With a heavy heart, Bharatha performed \\nall the rites a son ought to do. \\nShatrugna wanted to punish Manthara for her evil thoughts and for \\nprovoking Kaikeyi. But Bharatha did not want to subject an old \\nwoman to cruel treatment and so, she was pardoned. \\nBharatha lost interest in everything. For hours, he sat alone and in \\nshame and anger thought about his father’s death and about Rama. \\nHe refused to be crowned as the king,” In Raghu dynasty has \\nwitnessed a younger son becoming the king. I have decided to bring \\nback Rama. I will go to the forest in his place.” \\nSo next day, Bharatha left Ayodhya with a large army. The People of \\nAyodhya followed him. The queens including Kaikeyi went with \\nthem. By that time Kaikeyi realized that she had committed a great \\nmistake. She was very repentant and wanted to plead with Rama to \\nforgive her. \\nWhen this group of soldiers and people reached the area where Guha \\nlived, he at first thought that Bharatha had brought his army to kill \\nRama and retain the kingdom even after the period of fourteen \\nyears. So he asked Bharatha “Why have you brought such a huge \\narmy? If you plan to attack Rama, you will have to defeat me first.” \\nBharatha was extremely hurt by this suspicion. But he explained to \\nGuha that he would take Rama back to Ayodhya and crown him the \\nking. Guha was very happy to hear this. So he helped Bharatha, his \\narmy and his retinue to cross the Ganga. \\nAs Bharatha and his army approached Chitrakut, Lakshmana saw \\nthem coming. He recognized the flag fluttering atop Bharatha chariot \\nand at once informed Rama about this “Brother, take up your bow, \\nBharatha is coming here with a big army to kill you. His mother \\nbanished you to the forest. He will not hesitate to kill him” he said \\nangrily. \\n\\n19 \\n \\nRama listened to Lakshmana calmly and said “Lakshmana, you have \\nmisunderstood Bharatha. He also has a lot of love towards him. He \\nprobably b has come here to ask me to return to Ayodhya. Don’t talk \\nhastily. And don’t talk ill of Bharatha.” \\nLakshmana never disobeyed his brother. So he kept quiet. As soon \\nas Bharatha saw Rama, he ran towards him and fell at his feet. \\nShatrugna also offered his salutations to Rama. \\nRama embraced his brothers and was concerned to see agony on \\ntheir faces. So he asked Bharatha “How is father? Have you taken \\nover the affairs of kingdom?” Bharatha could not himself any longer \\nand sobbing he said “Our father died heart –broken. He could not \\nbear the grief of your exile.” \\nOn hearing this news, tears welled up Rama’s eyes. “Bharatha, how \\nunfortunate I am! I could not look after my father at his death bed. \\nNeither did I have the opportunity to perform my father’s last rites.” \\nSita and Lakshmana were also shocked to hear about king \\nDasharatha death. \\nBharatha who had come dressed in the clothes of a hermit told his \\nbrother. “Rama, please return to Ayodhya and rule over it, instead of \\nyou, I will stay back in the forest. Rama was deeply moved by \\nBharatha love for him. But he said in a firm voice. No, Bharatha, I am \\nhere to fulfill my father’s promise. You should also respect his \\nwishes. We should not disobey our father. I will rule over Ayodhya \\nonly after completing my exile in the forest.” \\nBharatha tried his level best to make Rama change his mind. The \\nsages also tried to influence Rama but in vain. \\nRama’s only answer was “It is my duty to carry out the wishes of my \\nparents.” \\nBharatha made one more attempt to persuade Rama. “I do not have \\nthe capability to rule over the kingdom. Come back to Ayodhya at \\nleast for my sake.” Rama smiled gently at this and said “Bharatha, \\nyou are very intelligent and capable person. You have the expert \\n\\n20 \\n \\nknowledge of your ministers with you. And the responsibility of \\nruling over Ayodhya is yours. Go back and rule over it well.” \\nWith no other option Bharatha said “Brother, I will rule over \\nAyodhya on your behalf. So please give me your sandals. I will place \\nthem on the throne.” Rama agreed to this, speaking again Bharatha \\nswore “I hereby take an oath that I shall await your return and for \\nthis period of fourteen years I shall not wear any royal clothes and I \\nshall subsist only on fruits and tubers. If you do not return on the \\nappointed day, I will jump into the fire and end my life.” \\nSuch was the love between the two brothers. Rama hugged his \\nbrother and advised him “Please treat our mother Kaikeyi well. Be \\nhappy. Be kind to others.” \\nFeeling sad that Rama was not returning to Ayodhya, all the people \\nleft Chitrakut silently. \\nBharatha placed his brother’s sandals over his head and carried \\nthem to Ayodhya. He did not like to live in Ayodhya without Rama. \\nSo he chose a small village called Nandhigram near Ayodhya. He \\nplaced the padukas (sandals) in the throne and coroneted them. “I \\nam merely a servant of my brother” he announced. “These padukas \\nare the true masters” he said. He showed due respect to these \\npadukas and remembering Rama at each and every step, ruled over \\nAyodhya. People felt safe and happy under him. \\nSri Rama wanted to go away from Chitrkut as the place reminded \\nhim of Bharatha and his mothers. So he decided to leave the area \\nand move on. The three of them wandered through dense forests, \\nleading a peaceful, contented life. \\n1.5 The demons in the forests \\nMany of these forests had sages living them. Many more had demons \\nin them, destroying everything and at times even disrupting the lives \\nof the sages.

You can then be \\nthe queen\". \\n \\nSurpanaka pestered Rama again. \"Rama, marry me. otherwise I will \\ngobble up Sita and then force you to marry me.\" \\n \\nRama refused and the angry Surpanaka tried to attack Sita. But \\nLakshmana quickly drew out his sword and cut off her ears and \\nnose. \\n \\nScreaming with pain and rage, Surpanaka ran to her brother Khara \\nand told him about how Rama and Lakshmana ill-treated her. \"I \\nwant to drink Sita\\'s blood. I also want the severed heads of Rama \\nand Lakshmana. My dear brother, please fulfill my wish\" she said. \\n \\nKhara who was infuriated on seeing the condition of his dear sister \\nordered fourteen of his fellow-demons to kill Rama and Lakshmana. \\nBut Rama knocked them down. Within moments, all of them were \\ndead. \\n \\nKhara then took a large army of Rakshasas with him and promised \\nhis sister that he would gift her Rama\\'s head. Each of the Rakshasas \\nof the army charged menacingly towards Rama. Rama fought against \\nthem single-handed while Lakshmana stood guard near Sita. Rama \\ndestroyed the entire army and soon killed Khara and Dushana also. \\nThe Rishis and the suras who were watching this battle showered \\npetals on Rama and hailed his victory over the demons. They were \\ngrateful to Rama for bringing peace to Dandakaranya. Sita was very \\nhappy that Rama fought valiantly against the powerful Khara and \\n\\n22 \\n \\nDushana. So did Lakshmana. \\n \\nSurpanaka who also witnessed the mighty power of Rama fled to \\nLanka. When she reached the court of Ravana, he was conducting a \\nmeeting with his ministers about an important matter relating to \\nLanka. Surpanaka entered the court in a dramatic way, crying loudly \\nand trying to cover her gaping nose with her hand. Ravana was \\nhorrified to see his sister in such condition. \\n \\nEven before he could say anything Surpanaka burst out talking \\n\"Ravana, my brother! All the Rakshasas have been killed. Khara and \\nDushana are dead. And imagine! just one human being is responsible \\nfor all this disaster. A man by name Rama has killed fourteen \\nthousand Rakshasas and also Khara and Dushana. Rama is no \\nordinary person. When he uses his arrows, it appears as though \\nthere is a rain of arrows. And here you are leading a life of luxury, \\nnot caring about your brothers who died at the hands of Rama.\"* \\n  \\nHe described to Maricha the way in which Surpanaka was disfigured \\nand how Khara and met a cruel death. “I have to take revenge \\nagainst Rama. Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.'), (6, '24 \\n \\nWhen Maricha’s cry reached Sita’s ears, she felt scared and told \\nLakshmana “Your brother is in danger. Please go to his rescue.” \\nLakshmana tried to calm her by assuring that no harm could ever \\ncome to Rama. When she insisted that Lakshmana leave at once in \\nsearch of Rama, Lakshmana refused. She got angry. “Lakshmana, \\ndidn’t you hear what I said? Instead of going to Rama’s help, you \\nstand here like a stone statue. Are you Rama’s enemy? Have you no \\nconcern for the safety of your brother?” Lakshmana was hurt by \\nSita’s words, but still he said calmly “Rama is very valiant. No harm \\ncan come to him. As I told you earlier, the golden deer was probably \\nMaricha. My brother Rama has instructed me not to leave you alone. \\nI shall follow his orders.”  \\nIn her anxiety about Rama’s safety Sita accused Lakshmana of evil \\nintentions and threatened to end her life if Lakshmana did not go to \\nRama’s help. \\nLakshmana was extremely hurt by Sita’s accusations and so, decided \\nto go in search of Rama. Before he went, he warned Sita to be \\ncareful about strangers. He also threw a line just outside the door of \\nthe hurt with his arrow and told her “Respected sister-in-law! Please \\ndo not across this line on any event. I will soon be back with Rama. \\nMay God protect you?” \\nRavana, who had hid behind a tree waiting for Sita to be left alone, \\nturned himself into a poor Sanyasini and called out in front of the \\nhut. “Alms for a poor Sanyasini!” Thinking that a hungry person was \\nat the door, Sita opened it with the food vessel in her hand. Ravana \\nfound her even more beautiful than ever and this made him \\ndetermined to have her at any cost. \\nSita stood at the door not wanting to cross the line Lakshmana had \\ndrawn in front of the hut. So, to make her cross the line, Ravana \\npretended to be very weak with hunger and said “My lady, please \\nhand over the alms to me here”. \\nAs soon as the unsuspecting Sita walked across the line, Ravana \\ngrabbed her hand and revealed his true identity. “O beautiful Sita, I \\nam Ravana, the mighty king of Lanka. I have come here to take you \\n\\n25 \\n \\nto my kingdom. Forgot about Rama, who cannot even feed you well \\nin this forest. I will treat you like a queen and give you all the \\nluxuries of life. \\nSita was very angry at such indecent talk. She tried to pull away her \\nhand. But Ravana ignored her warnings and pleas and forcibly \\ndragged her to his Pushpak Viman. Soon he was air-borne. Sita, who \\nwas rambling like a fawn cried out “Rama, Rama. Lakshmana. Where \\nare you? The wicked Ravana is taking me away.” But there was no \\nresponse. So, she made a fervent plea to the trees and the birds to \\nconvey the message to Rama that she was in distress. Jatayu, the \\nking of bird, heard her cries. As soon as she saw him, she pleaded \\nwith Jatayu. “Will you please tell Rama about my kidnapping and \\nsave me from this wicked man? Jatayu blocked Ravana’s way and \\nadvised him “Leave Sita alone. A king of your stature should not \\nresort to such wicked act. Sita is another man’s wife. What would \\nyou have done if your wife was kidnapped by another man? Rama \\nwill certainly kill you for this. But before that, I will fight against you \\nand rescue Sita”. \\nRavana laughed at Jatayu. “You are nothing but a bird. Are you \\ngoing to rescue this beautiful lady?” \\n“I will show you my strength” challenged Jatayu. And then they \\nfought with each other high up in the skies. Jatayu scratched and \\ninjured Ravana’s body with his sharp claws. He was deeply touched \\nby Sita’s tears and her helpless conditions. So, even at the cost of his \\nown life, Jatayu fought with Ravana. With his powerful wings, he \\nbroke Ravana’s bow, this made Ravana very angry and he chopped \\nJatayu’s wings with his sword. He cut off the legs too. Jatayu lost \\nthe power to fly and fell to the ground. Sita was dismayed that \\nJatayu died for her sake. She plunged into immense sorrow. Ravana \\nagain flew to Lanka along with Sita. \\nOn the way, the helpless Sita cursed Ravana. “Wicked Ravana, you \\nhave invited death, for, my husband is not an ordinary man. He is \\nthe bravest among the brave. He is unrivalled in the art of warfare. \\nHe can kill you with a single arrow,” threatened Sita. None of these \\n\\n26 \\n \\nwords had any effect on Ravana. He was mighty pleased with \\nhimself that he was about to enjoy Sita’s company. \\nFeeling desperate, Sita looked down and noticed a group of monkey \\nmen sitting atop a hill. Without losing any more time, she removed \\nall her ornaments, wrapped them in a portion of her upper garment \\nand threw down the bundle so that if fell amidst the monkey men. \\nThe surprised monkey men looked up but by that time Ravana had \\nzoomed past them. He crossed the ocean and reached Lanka. \\nRavana kept Sita in his royal chamber and appointed Rakshasis to \\nguard her. He instructed them to look after Sita well and to hurt her \\nany way. Ravana thus hoped that Sita would eventually change her \\nmind about him and agree to be his queen. \\nThat’s why Ravana made it a habit to visit her every day, carrying \\nexpensive gifts with him. He pestered her, pleaded with him. He \\npestered her, pleaded with her and tried all sorts of methods to \\nmake Sita agree to his desire. \\nSita was disgusted by the way he talked. As soon as Ravana came to \\nthe chamber, she would close her eyes and close her ears with her \\nhands. \\n“Ravanasur, you are talking to me in an immoral way. Whatever you \\nsay or do, I won’t even look at you or listen to you. You tricked me \\ninto believing that you are a Sanyasi, Alas! I did not listen to \\nLakshmana’s advice,” Lamented Sita. Every day she wept bitterly at \\nher misfortune. \\nIrritated with her persistent refusals, Ravana warned her “Sita, I \\nwill allow you one year’s time. If by then, you do not change your \\nmind and wed me, I shall cut you into pieces. He ordered the \\nRakshasis to guard Sita in Asoka garden and to try to make her \\nagree to his proposal. \\n1.7 Rama searches for Sita \\nWhen Lakshmana reached the spot where Maricha lay dead, both \\nRama and Lakshmana at once knew that Sita was in danger. So they')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Surpanaka with 2 references, [(5, '21 \\n \\nA thatched hut was specially erected for them.

So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama.

Only then will my brothers find peace in heaven. \\nThat’s why I want to separate Sita and Rama” Said Ravana. \\nMaricha, who had earlier faced Rama’s arrows, trembled with fear \\njust at mention of his name. “Ravana, you are ill –advised. Carrying \\naway Sita is to carry death with you. Sita is another man’s wife. Give \\nup such wicked thoughts and go back to Lanka” advised Maricha. \\nRavana would not listen to Maricha. He insisted on Maricha’s help \\nand then explained his plan. “Maricha, if you are so afraid of Rama’s \\narrows, you need not face him at all. You have magical powers and \\ncan turn yourself into any other form. All that I ask of you is to turn \\nyourself into a beautiful golden deer and roam in front of Sita’s hut. \\nSita will definitely want you. So she will ask Rama and Lakshmana to \\ncatch you. When they try to chase you, you can run fast and take \\nthem away from Panchavati. With none to protect her, Sita can be \\neasily kidnapped. And unable to bear the separation, Rama will die”. \\nMaricha once again told Ravana “O king! You already have so many \\nbeautiful wives. Do not lust for Sita. She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed. He preferred to die at Rama’s hands and so \\nagreed to Ravana’s plans. Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful. Look after Sita till I return.” So saying \\nRama went in pursuit of the animal. \\nRama ran behind the deer and just as he was about to catch it, it ran \\nfaster and faster. Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita! Ah Lakshmana!” Rama at once \\nrealized that this was a trick of the Rakshasa and feeling for the \\nsafety of Sita, hurried back to the Ashram.'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama.

She will be the cause of your \\ndeath and destruction of Lanka. \\n\\n23 \\n \\n“Ha… Ha….” Laughed Ravana scornfully. “How can an ordinary man \\nlike Rama cause my death? I live across the ocean and he cannot \\neven reach me there.” \\n“I am warning you Maricha” he continued. “If you do not help me in \\nthis plan, I will kill you at this very spot.” Maricha knew that either \\nway he would be killed.

Ravana took him in his Pushpak Viman \\nand dropped him near Panchavati. \\n1.6 The Kidnapping of Sita \\nMaricha turned himself into a golden deer and roamed in front of \\nSita’s hut at a time when she came out to pluck flowers. Sita was \\nenchanted to see such a beautiful creature and called out to Rama \\n“Can you please catch this exquisite creature for me?” she asked. \\n“Let us take to Ayodhya when we get back” she suggested. \\nLakshmana who also saw the golden deer was cautious. So he told \\nRama “Brother, somehow I feel that this is not a real animal. I feel \\nthat this is some Rakshasa in the guise of a deer.” \\nSri Rama had also taken a great liking for the deer and he brushed \\nLakshmana advice aside. \\n “Lakshmana, this deer is rather, unusual. I also like it as much as \\nJanaki. If, as you say, it is really a Rakshasa. I can kill it and get rid \\nof the Rakshasa. Be careful.

Rama chased it on and on but he still could not \\ncatch it. Tired and unable to catch it alive, Rama used his arrow. As \\nsoon as the arrow hit the deer, it fell down and its body turned once \\nagain into the body of a Rakshasa. Before dying Maricha imitated \\nRama’s voice and cried out “Ah Sita!

At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone. Lakshmana tried to explain to Rama about how reluctant he \\nwas to leave Sita insisted that he go in search of Rama. \\nBut this did not console Rama in any way.

All their efforts to trace Sita were in \\nvain Rama and Lakshmana did not give up their efforts to find Sita. \\nThey kept on walking and suddenly they noticed Jatayu, who was \\nwounded and was bleeding profusely. Rama at first thought that this \\nwas a Rakshasa in the form of a bird and drew out his arrow to kill \\nJatayu. Just then he heard Jatayu say in a feeble voice “Rama, I am \\nJatayu. I tried to prevent Ravana from abducting Sita and just look \\nat my condition! I am about to die any moment now.

He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven.

What would \\nyou have done if your wife was kidnapped by another man? Rama \\nwill certainly kill you for this. But before that, I will fight against you \\nand rescue Sita”. \\nRavana laughed at Jatayu. “You are nothing but a bird. Are you \\ngoing to rescue this beautiful lady?” \\n“I will show you my strength” challenged Jatayu. And then they \\nfought with each other high up in the skies. Jatayu scratched and \\ninjured Ravana’s body with his sharp claws. He was deeply touched \\nby Sita’s tears and her helpless conditions. So, even at the cost of his \\nown life, Jatayu fought with Ravana. With his powerful wings, he \\nbroke Ravana’s bow, this made Ravana very angry and he chopped \\nJatayu’s wings with his sword. He cut off the legs too. Jatayu lost \\nthe power to fly and fell to the ground. Sita was dismayed that \\nJatayu died for her sake. She plunged into immense sorrow. Ravana \\nagain flew to Lanka along with Sita. \\nOn the way, the helpless Sita cursed Ravana. “Wicked Ravana, you \\nhave invited death, for, my husband is not an ordinary man. He is \\nthe bravest among the brave. He is unrivalled in the art of warfare. \\nHe can kill you with a single arrow,” threatened Sita. None of these \\n\\n26 \\n \\nwords had any effect on Ravana. He was mighty pleased with \\nhimself that he was about to enjoy Sita’s company. \\nFeeling desperate, Sita looked down and noticed a group of monkey \\nmen sitting atop a hill. Without losing any more time, she removed \\nall her ornaments, wrapped them in a portion of her upper garment \\nand threw down the bundle so that if fell amidst the monkey men. \\nThe surprised monkey men looked up but by that time Ravana had \\nzoomed past them. He crossed the ocean and reached Lanka. \\nRavana kept Sita in his royal chamber and appointed Rakshasis to \\nguard her. He instructed them to look after Sita well and to hurt her \\nany way. Ravana thus hoped that Sita would eventually change her \\nmind about him and agree to be his queen. \\nThat’s why Ravana made it a habit to visit her every day, carrying \\nexpensive gifts with him. He pestered her, pleaded with him. He \\npestered her, pleaded with her and tried all sorts of methods to \\nmake Sita agree to his desire. \\nSita was disgusted by the way he talked. As soon as Ravana came to \\nthe chamber, she would close her eyes and close her ears with her \\nhands. \\n“Ravanasur, you are talking to me in an immoral way. Whatever you \\nsay or do, I won’t even look at you or listen to you. You tricked me \\ninto believing that you are a Sanyasi, Alas! I did not listen to \\nLakshmana’s advice,” Lamented Sita. Every day she wept bitterly at \\nher misfortune. \\nIrritated with her persistent refusals, Ravana warned her “Sita, I \\nwill allow you one year’s time. If by then, you do not change your \\nmind and wed me, I shall cut you into pieces. He ordered the \\nRakshasis to guard Sita in Asoka garden and to try to make her \\nagree to his proposal. \\n1.7 Rama searches for Sita \\nWhen Lakshmana reached the spot where Maricha lay dead, both \\nRama and Lakshmana at once knew that Sita was in danger. So they'), (9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one')]...\n",

Please kill Ravana, free Sita and lead a happy life.” He \\ndied in Rama’s arms, contented that he had the good fortune or \\nrendering some service to Rama. \\nRama perfumed Jatayu’s last rites as a son would do for his father. \\nThen Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey westwards. \\nOn third way, they were stopped by a cruel looking Rakshasa. He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven. Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend. He will help you to \\nknow the whereabouts Sita. \\nSo the two brothers proceeded towards Rishyamukha. Tired and \\nhungry, they noticed an Ashram. Sabari, a Sanyasini lived here. She \\nwas very old and could hardly see or walk. But still she had gathered \\nnuts and fruits hoping to feed them to Rama. Henve when she saw \\nRama along with his brother at her doorsteps, her happiness knew \\nno bounds. She extended her hospitality to them. \\nSabari’s love and devotion towards Rama earned her a place in \\nheaven.  \\nFrom Sabari’s Ashram, Rama and Lakshmana reached the hills of \\nRishyamukha and rested for a while near Pampa lake. \\n1.8 The land of the monkeys \\nEven when Sri Rama tried to take some rest, he always pined for \\nSita. He could not eat .Never could he sleep. Lakshmana who sadly \\nwatched his brother’s condition, tried to instill some hope and \\nconfidence in him. “Dear brother” he told Rama “Please do not lose \\nheart. I am sure we can trace Sita and free her from Ravana.” \\n“Then, let us not waste any more time” said Rama and soon they \\nreached Rishyamukha was a hilly region where many Varanas* lived. \\nSugriva was their leader. He had the assistance and friendship of \\nHanuman, a valiant and highly intelligent Vanara. \\nSugriva had an elder brother called Vali. Vali was the king of \\nKishkinda. The two brothers loved each other. Once Vali had to fight'), (8, '29 \\n \\nagainst a demon and chased him into a cave, before entering he \\nasked Sugriva to stand guard at its entrance. Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.')]...\n",

Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Sabari with 2 references, [(7, '27 \\n \\nhurried back to Panchavati but were shocked to find it empty. They \\nsearched and searched for her. Rama went to the Godavari bank but \\ncould not find her there.  \\nRama was heart-broken. Life seemed meaningless without Sita. With \\ntears rolling down his cheeks, he recalled the way in which Sita \\nwould stroll in the garden, how happy she was in Panchavati and so \\non. At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone. Lakshmana tried to explain to Rama about how reluctant he \\nwas to leave Sita insisted that he go in search of Rama. \\nBut this did not console Rama in any way. He roamed through the \\nforests like a madman, calling out her name so often, talking to \\nplants and animals about Sita. All their efforts to trace Sita were in \\nvain Rama and Lakshmana did not give up their efforts to find Sita. \\nThey kept on walking and suddenly they noticed Jatayu, who was \\nwounded and was bleeding profusely. Rama at first thought that this \\nwas a Rakshasa in the form of a bird and drew out his arrow to kill \\nJatayu. Just then he heard Jatayu say in a feeble voice “Rama, I am \\nJatayu. I tried to prevent Ravana from abducting Sita and just look \\nat my condition! I am about to die any moment now. Sri Rama, are \\nyou going to kill me.” \\nRama kept aside his weapons, picked up the bird in his arms and \\ngently touched his body. Jatayu told Rama “Rama! I tried my best to \\nsave Sita. Please kill Ravana, free Sita and lead a happy life.” He \\ndied in Rama’s arms, contented that he had the good fortune or \\nrendering some service to Rama. \\nRama perfumed Jatayu’s last rites as a son would do for his father. \\nThen Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey westwards. \\nOn third way, they were stopped by a cruel looking Rakshasa. He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven. Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend. He will help you to \\nknow the whereabouts Sita. \\nSo the two brothers proceeded towards Rishyamukha. Tired and \\nhungry, they noticed an Ashram. Sabari, a Sanyasini lived here. She \\nwas very old and could hardly see or walk. But still she had gathered \\nnuts and fruits hoping to feed them to Rama. Henve when she saw \\nRama along with his brother at her doorsteps, her happiness knew \\nno bounds. She extended her hospitality to them. \\nSabari’s love and devotion towards Rama earned her a place in \\nheaven.  \\nFrom Sabari’s Ashram, Rama and Lakshmana reached the hills of \\nRishyamukha and rested for a while near Pampa lake. \\n1.8 The land of the monkeys \\nEven when Sri Rama tried to take some rest, he always pined for \\nSita. He could not eat .Never could he sleep. Lakshmana who sadly \\nwatched his brother’s condition, tried to instill some hope and \\nconfidence in him. “Dear brother” he told Rama “Please do not lose \\nheart. I am sure we can trace Sita and free her from Ravana.” \\n“Then, let us not waste any more time” said Rama and soon they \\nreached Rishyamukha was a hilly region where many Varanas* lived. \\nSugriva was their leader. He had the assistance and friendship of \\nHanuman, a valiant and highly intelligent Vanara. \\nSugriva had an elder brother called Vali. Vali was the king of \\nKishkinda. The two brothers loved each other. Once Vali had to fight'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain.

Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki.

At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone.

All their efforts to trace Sita were in \\nvain Rama and Lakshmana did not give up their efforts to find Sita. \\nThey kept on walking and suddenly they noticed Jatayu, who was \\nwounded and was bleeding profusely. Rama at first thought that this \\nwas a Rakshasa in the form of a bird and drew out his arrow to kill \\nJatayu. Just then he heard Jatayu say in a feeble voice “Rama, I am \\nJatayu. I tried to prevent Ravana from abducting Sita and just look \\nat my condition! I am about to die any moment now.

He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven. Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend. He will help you to \\nknow the whereabouts Sita. \\nSo the two brothers proceeded towards Rishyamukha. Tired and \\nhungry, they noticed an Ashram. Sabari, a Sanyasini lived here. She \\nwas very old and could hardly see or walk. But still she had gathered \\nnuts and fruits hoping to feed them to Rama.

She extended her hospitality to them. \\nSabari’s love and devotion towards Rama earned her a place in \\nheaven.  \\nFrom Sabari’s Ashram, Rama and Lakshmana reached the hills of \\nRishyamukha and rested for a while near Pampa lake. \\n1.8 The land of the monkeys \\nEven when Sri Rama tried to take some rest, he always pined for \\nSita.

I am sure we can trace Sita and free her from Ravana.” \\n“Then, let us not waste any more time” said Rama and soon they \\nreached Rishyamukha was a hilly region where many Varanas* lived. \\nSugriva was their leader. He had the assistance and friendship of \\nHanuman, a valiant and highly intelligent Vanara. \\nSugriva had an elder brother called Vali. Vali was the king of \\nKishkinda. The two brothers loved each other. Once Vali had to fight'), (8, '29 \\n \\nagainst a demon and chased him into a cave, before entering he \\nasked Sugriva to stand guard at its entrance. Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.')]...\n",

Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.')]...\n",

Rama went to the Godavari bank but \\ncould not find her there.  \\nRama was heart-broken. Life seemed meaningless without Sita. With \\ntears rolling down his cheeks, he recalled the way in which Sita \\nwould stroll in the garden, how happy she was in Panchavati and so \\non. At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone. Lakshmana tried to explain to Rama about how reluctant he \\nwas to leave Sita insisted that he go in search of Rama. \\nBut this did not console Rama in any way. He roamed through the \\nforests like a madman, calling out her name so often, talking to \\nplants and animals about Sita. All their efforts to trace Sita were in \\nvain Rama and Lakshmana did not give up their efforts to find Sita. \\nThey kept on walking and suddenly they noticed Jatayu, who was \\nwounded and was bleeding profusely. Rama at first thought that this \\nwas a Rakshasa in the form of a bird and drew out his arrow to kill \\nJatayu. Just then he heard Jatayu say in a feeble voice “Rama, I am \\nJatayu. I tried to prevent Ravana from abducting Sita and just look \\nat my condition! I am about to die any moment now. Sri Rama, are \\nyou going to kill me.” \\nRama kept aside his weapons, picked up the bird in his arms and \\ngently touched his body. Jatayu told Rama “Rama! I tried my best to \\nsave Sita. Please kill Ravana, free Sita and lead a happy life.” He \\ndied in Rama’s arms, contented that he had the good fortune or \\nrendering some service to Rama. \\nRama perfumed Jatayu’s last rites as a son would do for his father. \\nThen Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey westwards. \\nOn third way, they were stopped by a cruel looking Rakshasa. He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome.

Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend.

Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him.

As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman.

Rama went to the Godavari bank but \\ncould not find her there.  \\nRama was heart-broken. Life seemed meaningless without Sita. With \\ntears rolling down his cheeks, he recalled the way in which Sita \\nwould stroll in the garden, how happy she was in Panchavati and so \\non. At times, he turned his wrath on Lakshmana for leaving Sita \\nalone. Lakshmana tried to explain to Rama about how reluctant he \\nwas to leave Sita insisted that he go in search of Rama. \\nBut this did not console Rama in any way. He roamed through the \\nforests like a madman, calling out her name so often, talking to \\nplants and animals about Sita. All their efforts to trace Sita were in \\nvain Rama and Lakshmana did not give up their efforts to find Sita. \\nThey kept on walking and suddenly they noticed Jatayu, who was \\nwounded and was bleeding profusely. Rama at first thought that this \\nwas a Rakshasa in the form of a bird and drew out his arrow to kill \\nJatayu. Just then he heard Jatayu say in a feeble voice “Rama, I am \\nJatayu. I tried to prevent Ravana from abducting Sita and just look \\nat my condition! I am about to die any moment now. Sri Rama, are \\nyou going to kill me.” \\nRama kept aside his weapons, picked up the bird in his arms and \\ngently touched his body. Jatayu told Rama “Rama! I tried my best to \\nsave Sita. Please kill Ravana, free Sita and lead a happy life.” He \\ndied in Rama’s arms, contented that he had the good fortune or \\nrendering some service to Rama. \\nRama perfumed Jatayu’s last rites as a son would do for his father. \\nThen Rama and Lakshmana continued their journey westwards. \\nOn third way, they were stopped by a cruel looking Rakshasa. He \\nhad arms which were several miles long. With one sweep of the arm, \\nthis Rakshasa, who name was Kabandha, lifted Rama and \\nLakshmana up in the air. He was about to gobble them up when both \\nof them chopped off his arms. Screaming with the pain, Kabandha \\nwanted to know who they were. When Rama revealed his identity, \\nKabandha bowed before him and narrated his story. \\n\\n28 \\n \\nKabandha was once very handsome. But he would turn himself into a \\nterrifying creature just to scare the Rishi cursed him “May this \\nhideous from stay! Only Rama comes to this forest and chops your \\nalms will you be able to regain your good-looks.” \\nKabandha got back his good looks and commanded a flying –\\nmachine to take him to heaven. Before departing, he wished Rama \\nand Lakshmana well and said “Rama,  \\nSugriva is a monkey king who lives in the hills of Rishyamukha by \\nthe side of Pampa lake. Make him your friend. He will help you to \\nknow the whereabouts Sita. \\nSo the two brothers proceeded towards Rishyamukha. Tired and \\nhungry, they noticed an Ashram. Sabari, a Sanyasini lived here. She \\nwas very old and could hardly see or walk. But still she had gathered \\nnuts and fruits hoping to feed them to Rama. Henve when she saw \\nRama along with his brother at her doorsteps, her happiness knew \\nno bounds. She extended her hospitality to them. \\nSabari’s love and devotion towards Rama earned her a place in \\nheaven.  \\nFrom Sabari’s Ashram, Rama and Lakshmana reached the hills of \\nRishyamukha and rested for a while near Pampa lake. \\n1.8 The land of the monkeys \\nEven when Sri Rama tried to take some rest, he always pined for \\nSita.

Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next.

So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event.

Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill.

So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Kishkinda with 2 references, [(8, '29 \\n \\nagainst a demon and chased him into a cave, before entering he \\nasked Sugriva to stand guard at its entrance. Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady.

You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.'), (9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one')]...\n",

Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \\nSampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \\nkilled by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \\nagainst Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \\nbeautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \\nSampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \\nIt is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \\nbeen built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \\nThe Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \\nat the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \\nvast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \\nbut only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \\nJambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \\nhave the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \\ncity. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \\nand land on Lanka. \\nEnthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \\nsucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \\nsky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \\nacross to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \\natop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \\nThis vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \\nhe was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \\nthe skies. \\nThe Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \\ndanced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \\nhumiliation.'), (9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too.

Sugriva waited there \\npatiently but since Vali did not come out for many days, he was \\nworried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \\nblood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \\nthe cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \\nkingdom was without a king, people crowned Sugriva as the king. \\nOne day all of a sudden Vali returned. When he came to know that \\nSugriva had become the king, he was very angry. He banished \\nSugriva from the kingdom and even kept back Sugriva’s wife for \\nhimself. \\nSugriva took shelter in Rishyamukha as Vali could not enter the area \\nbecause of a curse. \\nWhen Rama and Lakshmana reached Rishyamuka, Sugriva at first \\nthought that they had come on behalf of Vali to kill him. So he sent \\nHanuman to find out who they were. \\nHanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \\nturn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \\nrakshasa called Ravana has abducted my sister-in-law. We do not \\nwhere he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \\nabout Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \\nSatisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \\nhis shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \\nSugriva lived. \\nSugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \\ntold him “Rama, I will help you in your search for Sita. Wherever she \\nis, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \\nsaw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \\n“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \\nher ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \\nPlease see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \\nasked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments. \\n\\n30 \\n \\nAs soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \\ncrying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \\nconsciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \\nthat these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \\nhead ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \\nnever looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \\nportion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \\nhave noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \\nrespect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \\nRama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \\nbelonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \\nseparated Sita from me”. \\nSugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \\nsend the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \\nIn return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \\nregaining his kingdom. \\nSugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \\nbravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \\npowerful Vali. \\n“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \\nI know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \\nknocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \\nalso prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \\nUpon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \\nmade Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \\nVali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \\nchallenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \\nVali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \\narrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \\nthe ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \\naround and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \\ntree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \\nrighteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \\nwhat grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me, \\n\\n31 \\n \\nRama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \\nis wrong?” \\nIn reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \\nbrother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \\nyou. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \\njustified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \\nVali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \\nSugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \\nangada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \\nSugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \\nabout helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \\nin a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \\nenjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \\ncould no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \\nrushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \\nhis promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \\nremained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \\nfriendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \\nRealising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \\nforgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \\nKishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \\nSugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \\nHe separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \\ncapable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \\nnews very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \\nHanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \\nshow her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \\nmessenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \\ntouching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \\nSugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \\nThey searched and searched but just could not get any news about \\nher. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \\nunder Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \\nthey sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them \\n\\n32 \\n \\ndared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \\nwithout news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \\nthey decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \\nleast we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \\nleast for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \\nfor Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \\nAt the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \\nthe sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir!

The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra!

      "Processing entity: Indrajit with 2 references, [(9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died.

He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",

She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth.

He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city.

He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",

Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone.

Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped.

She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama.

The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also.

You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

      "Processing entity: Devas with 2 references, [(9, '33 \\n \\n1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \\nHanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \\non him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \\nson success. \\nTo test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \\nwho obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one'), (10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama.

The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \\nheat.

She turned herself into a \\ndemoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \\nsize. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \\nHanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \\nmouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \\neven before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \\nout of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \\nwell. \\nHanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \\nthem. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \\nhad been set up. \\nLanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \\ncity was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \\nand night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \\ndecided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \\nit was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \\nand enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \\nand she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \\nHanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \\nnose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \\nentered the city. \\nBearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \\nher all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \\nRakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \\nfind Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \\nchamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \\nher there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \\nMandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \\ngot worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama \\n\\n34 \\n \\nwould die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \\nthe news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \\nAyodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \\nto bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \\nconsequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \\nreturn to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \\nSearching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \\nhundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \\na beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \\npale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \\nwho kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \\nrecalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \\nhappy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \\nsorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \\nundergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \\nalone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \\nbranches. \\nIn a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \\nmake Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \\nwanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \\nwhat Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \\nbelong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \\nThat will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \\nordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \\nexception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \\nbut in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \\nbear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \\ntree and die. \\nHanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \\nstopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \\nwas up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \\nRama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \\nthe noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \\nbowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \\nservant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \\nthe ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as \\n\\n35 \\n \\nsoon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \\nHanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \\nagainst Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge.

She gave Hanuman one \\nof her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \\nLet him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \\nno obstacles in your way. Be successful. \\nNow that Hanuman had met Sita, he decided that he would find out \\nabout Ravenna’s army and his strength and inform Sugriva of them. \\nHe had a plan. He provoked all the Rakshasas to attack him and \\nwhen they did, he jumped and trampled all the trees in Asoka \\ngarden. The Rakshasas rushed to capture him but he killed them, \\nwhen Ravenna’s commander-in-chief and other able soldiers tried to \\ncatch the monkey but were defeated and killed by the mighty \\nmonkey. When Ravana heard about the destruction caused by a \\nmonkey, he sent his son Indrajit to capture the monkey. \\nIndrajit was a very skilled warrior, who, at one time, had even \\ndefeated Devendra. He used one of his powerful weapons on \\nHanuman, imprisoned him and dragged him to Ravenna’s court. \\nWhen Hanuman was brought before the king, he was very impressed \\nwith the ten-headed Ravana. His court was very grand and dazzling. \\nRavana was sitting on a high throne. As soon as Hanuman came face \\nto face with Ravana, he freed himself from chains and ropes, \\nprepared a high seat out of his very long tail and sat on it. \\n“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \\ngarden” asked Ravana. \\n“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \\nsearch of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \\nSita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \\nrefuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \\nHaving warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \\nhave rescued Sita from here and carry her on my shoulders. But I do \\nnot have such orders. Only Rama should do this. And don’t \\nunderestimate Rama. He is the lord of the entire universe. Don’t \\nseek your own destruction by angering him.”  \\n\\n36 \\n \\nRavana was very angry “How dare a monkey talk to a king like me in \\nsuch a way” he thundered. He ordered his soldiers “Kill this arrogant \\nVanara.” But Vibhishana, his brother, stopped him. “Brother, he is \\nafter all Rama’s messenger. A king does not kill a messenger. \\nInstead, you can punish him suitably and let him suitably and let him \\ngo back to Rama. He can tell Rama about strength and power. \\n“Yes brother” agreed Ravana “What you say makes sense.” He then \\nordered his servants to set fire to Hanuman’s long tail and make him \\nwalk in the streets of Lanka. \\nThe Rakshasas dipped the monkey’s tail in oil and set fire to it. \\nAnjaneya used it as a whip and lashed all the Rakshasas. He then \\njumped from building and reduced them to ashes, he did not even \\nspare Ravenna’s place. The whole of Lanka looked like an enormous \\nfire pit. \\nHe only spared the Ashoka garden. He made sure that Sita was safe \\nand after seeking her blessings, left Lanka. He dipped his tail in the \\nsea water, expanded his body, climbed a nearby mountain and with \\na powerful thrust, flew off. \\nHanuman reached Kishkinda and told Rama all about Sita’s safety. \\nHe conveyed her message also. He then handed over the ornament \\nSita had sent as a momento. \\nSugriva and the entire Vanara army felt proud that Hanuman was \\nable to accomplish his mission. Sugriva hugged Hanuman and \\ncongratulated him. \\n1.10 The War \\nRama too was very happy that Hanuman was successful in finding \\nSita. Sugriva had kept up his word and Rama now had to plan about \\nreaching Lanka, kill Ravana and rescue Sita. He therefore talked to \\nSugriva about this. “Sugriva, you have proved to be my true friend. I \\nwant more help from you because I am afraid that Ravana might kill \\nSita to take revenge. Hence, please get your army ready.” Rama \\ncalled Hanuman also to his side and holding his hands warmly said \\n“Maruthi I am so grateful to you for your help. You are the only one')]...\n",
      "Processing entity: Vishnu with 1 references, [(10, '37 \\n \\namong us who is capable of flying across the ocean. So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n",

Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph.

This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting.

Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka.

So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.

But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground.

With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again.

May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law.

Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise.

At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting.

Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you.

He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.

He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya.

Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali.

You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki.

So, Please tell \\nus how we can get there.” Rama also asked his trusted friend about \\nLanka’s city plan, about its main gates, about trenches built around \\nthe fort and many more such information to plan the attack: Though \\nHanuman had burnt down Lanka; Ravana had the city rebuilt \\nimmediately. Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya.

So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness.

Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days.

Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita.

But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it. I \\nshall summon Angada, Neela, Jabavanta and many more valiant \\nVanaras and bears and be ready to leave.” \\nUpon Sugriva’s orders, thousands of Vanaras formed a huge army \\nand walked towards the ocean. But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka. Rama, please accept me as your humble servant.” \\nSugriva and the other Vanara leaders did not like this request, so \\nthey told Rama “Rama, Vibhishana belongs to the enemy camp. \\nMoreover he is a Rakshasa and a trickster. So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers.

Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting.

Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka.

So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death. He expects you to help him \\njust the way you helped Sugriva against Vali. In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.

But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war.

But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise.

At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting.

Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka.

So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death.

On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.

But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law.

But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes.

May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile.

Anjaneya who was aware of this told Rama “Lord! Once \\nwe cross the ocean, Lanka will be ours. Have no doubt about it.

But the vast expanse of water \\nstopped them in their march. They just could not think of any \\nmethod by which they could cross the ocean. They were afraid that \\nwould drown in the water. \\nIn Lanka also, many people were afraid of the consequences of war. \\nThey had seen the power of just one monkey. If thousands of such \\nmonkeys attacked Lanka, what would be the fate, many wondered. \\nThe Rakshasas tried to talk courageously and boasted “Rama and his \\nVanaras will be like insects in our hands. \\nOnly one person among them was wise. He was Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s younger brother. He was a devotee of lord Vishnu and a \\nvery righteous man. While the other were advising Ravana about \\npreparing for the war, Vibhishana stood up in the meeting and told \\nhis brother “Ravana, do not act in haste. First and foremost, you \\nhave been responsible for this danger. You have sinned in longing \\nfor another man’s wife. So, please listen to me. At least now, let us \\nsend back Sita to Rama before he attacks. Then peace will prevail on \\nboth the sides.” \\nRavana did not like Vibhisana’s words “I am not a coward. I am not \\nsending Sita back to Rama. Please don’t interfere in our plans.” He \\nscolded his brother. \\nKumbakarna, another brother of Ravana, was also present at the \\nmeeting. He was a Rakshasa who slept for six months at stretch. On \\nwaking up, he would eat lots and lots of food and go back to sleep \\n\\n38 \\n \\nagain. Just that day, he had finished one round of sleeping. Though \\nhe did not like Ravenna’s behavior, he decided to support him out of \\nbrotherly love and loyalty. \\nVibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \\nwar. He again advised him “Ravana, king of Lanka! Do you know \\nwho Sita is? She is a Goddess who can destroy evil. Her husband Sri \\nRama is the Lord of the Universe. None can fight against him. Not \\neven Kumbakarna or you. So, act sensibly and send back Sita. \\nRavana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \\nwas behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \\nanyone. When he once again suggested that Ravana should avoid \\nwar with Rama, Ravana was very angry. \\nVibhishana, are you really my brother? You talk as if I am your \\nenemy. I have spared you because I still have some affection for \\nyou. Otherwise I would have killed you this very moment. Don’t ever \\nstep into Lanka again. Get out from here”. \\nFeeling sad that his brother ignored his advice, Vibhishana, with four \\nof his followers, went to Rama and sought refuge under him. \\n“Sri” Vibhishana introduced himself to Rama, “I am Vibhishana, \\nRavenna’s brother. I have come to seek refuge under you. I tried my \\nlevel best to make Ravana realize his mistake. I told him to hand \\nover Sita and make peace with you. He ridiculed me and drove me \\nout of Lanka.

So, please think about \\nthis before you come to any decision. Hunumanth then remembered \\nhow Vibhishana had sided him in Ravenna’s court. So, he told Rama \\n“Rama, Vibhishana has probably approached you as he can become \\nthe king of Lanka after Ravenna’s death.

In my humble opinion, \\nwe should accept Vibhisana’s friendship”. \\n\\n39 \\n \\nRama agreed with Hanuman and said “It is my duty to protect those \\nwho seek refuge in me “. On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces.

On hearing these words, Vibhishana fell at \\nRama’s feet and thanked him for this gesture. \\nSri Rama embraced Vibhishana and promised him that upon \\nRavenna’s death he would be the king of Lanka. He then asked his \\nfriend about Ravenna’s army and Vibhishana explained everything in \\ndetail to him. \\nUnder Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \\nsea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \\nwas ready and cheering with excitement, the Vanara army crossed \\nthe sea and reached Lanka. \\nAs soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \\ndivided them into battalions and placed each group at important \\nplaces. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \\nblown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \\nin the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \\nand injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \\nNeel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \\n“Victory to Sri Rama!” \\nThe Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \\ntheir magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \\nVanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \\nThis upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \\nvery easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \\nthat Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \\nThis filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \\n“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \\nIndrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \\nand valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \\nserpent-like arrows which entwined themselves around Rama and \\nLakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \\nRama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \\nground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \\nhis father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news \\n\\n40 \\n \\nwas conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \\nher the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \\nstricken that her dearest husband was dead. \\nSoon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \\nLakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \\nknew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \\nregained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \\nsnake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \\nextremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \\nheaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \\nsnakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \\non them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \\nRama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \\nthem to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \\nRavana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \\neach one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \\nvaliant Vanaras. \\nRavana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \\nwho was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \\nbrother. \\n“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \\nKumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \\nbed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \\nmassive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \\nfield. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \\nHanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \\nSugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \\nbehind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \\nfierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \\nand chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \\nwhich separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \\ndied. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \\nRavana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \\nhe decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka, \\n\\n41 \\n \\nNaranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \\nmatch for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \\ndeaths too. \\nRavana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \\nslumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \\ntried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \\nalive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \\nspare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \\nApart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \\npossessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \\nLakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \\nupon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \\nand soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \\nLakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \\nother end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \\nthe ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \\ncalled Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \\nbe very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \\nHanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \\nfind Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \\nRama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \\nfighting. \\nIndrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \\nto look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\\nfield and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \\nothers, severed her head. \\nThe Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \\nLakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \\nto a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \\ndestroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \\nstruck down Inderjit’s head. \\nThe Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \\nLakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \\ndied at Inderjit’s hands. \\n\\n42 \\n \\nInderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \\nsons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \\nplunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \\nRavana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \\n“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \\ncitizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \\nhouse in Lanka. \\nRavana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \\nfierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \\nLakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\\nair. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \\nbroke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \\narrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \\nwould become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \\nwere futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \\nThis was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \\nordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \\nWith Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \\nthem was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \\ncelestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \\nend at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \\nhis end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \\nBrahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \\nworn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \\ndown and died. The evil was vanquished.  \\nThe Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \\nVanaras went back with joy. Only Vibhishana, Mandodari and \\nRavenna’s other queens were plunged into grief. \\nOn Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \\nRama who was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu thus brought peace to \\nthe land. All the Rishis and Devas rejoiced that Rakshasas had been \\nwiped out. \\nRama kept up his word and crowned Vibhishana as the king of \\nLanka. \\n\\n43 \\n \\nSri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \\nthat at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \\nto rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \\nHe wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \\nsaid “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \\nhad not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \\ncannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \\nheart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \\nkept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \\nvirtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \\nturned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \\nRama did not object. \\nSita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \\nrescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \\nIndra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \\nthis scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \\ndispleasure to Rama. “Ramachandra! You are the lord of universe. \\nHow could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \\nwatch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \\nhand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \\nLakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \\ndistrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \\nRama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \\ndoubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \\nRama, Sita and Lakshmana were blessed by all the Gods. Rama’s \\nexile had come to an end. So he bade good bye to all his Vanara \\nfriends, he thanked Vibhishana for his help. Rama, Sita and \\nLakshmana accompanied by Sugriva and Hanuman left for Ayodhya \\nin Pushpak Viman arranged by Vibhishana. On their flight, Sita and \\nRama identified the places they had stayed during the exile. Rama \\nalso showed her the Rishyamukha, Pampa lake, Sabari’s ashram and \\nKishkinda and the forests where he had roamed pining for Sita. \\nThe Pushpak Viman reached Ayodhya. Bharatha was waiting for \\nRama’s return. He prostrated before his brother and begged him to \\ntake charge of the kingdom. Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, Sumitra and \\n\\n44 \\n \\nVashishta blessed Rama and with their consent, Rama agreed to \\nbecome the king. \\nSoon Rama was crowned the king of Ayodhya. The coronation was \\nconducted on a grand scale, Rama and Sita were seated on the \\nthrone, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrugna stood behind them \\nHanuman sat at Rama’s feet. \\nPeople rejoiced about this happy event. The festivities continued for \\na week and Rama made generous gifts to everyone.  \\nSri Rama ruled over Ayodhya for many years. People lived a happy, \\ncontented life in the kingdom and this glorious reign was hailed as \\nRama Rajya. \\n \\nThis is the story of Ramayana .This epic was written by Maharishi \\nValmiki. Reading Ramayana will help us to follow Rama’s ideals, his \\ndevotion towards his parents, his values and his truthfulness. Let us \\nall strive to be better human beings.')]...\n"
