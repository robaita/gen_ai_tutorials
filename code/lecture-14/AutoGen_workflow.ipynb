      "   - **SRAM (Static RAM):** Faster and more expensive than DRAM. It does not need to be refreshed as it uses a flip-flop design.\n",
      "   - **SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM):** SDRAM synchronizes itself with the CPU's bus speed, allowing for faster data transfer rates.\n",
      "   - **DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM):** An improved version of SDRAM that can send data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock cycle, effectively doubling the data rate.\n",
      "   - **DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5:** Successive generations of DDR SDRAM, with each offering increased data transfer rates and improved efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RAM Usage:**\n",
      "   - RAM is used by the operating system and applications to store data for quick access during processing.\n",
      "   - More RAM allows for smoother multitasking, faster loading times, and improved overall system performance.\n",
