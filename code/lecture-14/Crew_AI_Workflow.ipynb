      "Sita, a central character in the Ramayana, is introduced in the Bala Kanda as the adopted daughter of King Janaka and Queen Sunaina of Mithila. Sita marries Rama in a self-choice ceremony called Swayamvara, after Rama successfully lifts the bow of Shiva. In the Ayodhya Kanda, Sita insists on accompanying Rama on his 14-year exile, demonstrating her unwavering devotion. The Aranya Kanda narrates Sita's abduction by the demon king, Ravana, using a golden deer as a distraction. While held captive in Lanka, as described in the Sundara Kanda, Sita remains devoted to Rama and rejects Ravana. Rama, with the help of an army of monkeys, rescues Sita in the Yuddha Kanda. To validate her chastity, Sita undergoes a trial by fire, emerging unscathed. The Uttara Kanda describes Sita's second exile due to rumors about her stay in Lanka. In exile, she gives birth to Lava and Kusha, Rama's twin sons. Unable to bear further accusations, Sita prays to Mother Earth, who takes her back, marking the end of her earthly life.\n"
