      "the arrow to it. He then asked Parushurama \"Sir, you are a Brahmin \n",

      "please tell me, at what do I aim the arrow at\". \n",

      "Parushurama was stunned with Ramas’s mastery over the weapon. \n",
      "He could not even say anything. He gazed at Rama. It dawned upon \n",
      "him that Rama was no ordinary person. He bowed his head and \n",
      "said\"Rama, I am no match for you. Hence this mighty bow belongs \n",
      "to you\". He then departed for the Himalayas to continue his penance. \n",
      " \n",

      "Soon after Rama's marriage with Sita, king Dasharatha wanted to \n",
      "crown him the king as himself was getting older. Dasharatha \n",
      "therefore consulted his ministers about this. All of them \n",
      "wholeheartedly welcomed this decision. Dasharatha felt very happy \n",
      "and enthusiastic. He looked forwarded to the coronation of Rama. He \n",
      "therefore immediately made announcements to this effect. He \n",
      "invited all the important people of Ayodhya and told them \"I have \n",
      "decided to crown my eldest son Rama. This is my ardent desire. If all \n",
      "of you agree .I will go ahead with the arrangements.\" Everybody \n",
      "was delighted. The people of Ayodhya rejoiced that Rama was to be \n",
      "their king. \n",
      " \n",
      "Hectic preparations were on. Singers, dancers and other artists were\n",
      "8 \n",
      " \n",
      "invited to the city to provide entertainment to the people. The chiefs \n",
      "of the city were instructed to decorate it on a very grand scale. Even \n",
      "while these preparations were going on. Dasahratha had a talk with \n",
      "Rama and advised him about how king should conduct himself. \"A \n",
      "king should never fall a prey to vices: He should treat each and every \n",
      "one with respect and rule the kingdom well\" was Dasharatha's \n",
      "advice to Rama. He also talked to his son about the duties of a king. \n",
      " \n",
      "Kaushalya was very happy to hear that Rama was to be crowned \n",
      "shortly. She generously gifted valuable jewelry to those who \n",
      "conveyed this good news to her.  \n",
      " \n",
      "At the time of proclaiming that Rama was to be crowned, Bharatha \n",
      "and Shatrugna were away from Ayodhya. Sumitra, Shatrugna \n",
      "mother was also happy to hear the news.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "When this news reached Kaikeyi, she was delighted that Rama was \n",
      "to be the king, but soon, Manthara, her maid poisoned her mind. \n",
      "“Kaika, have you forgotten that you also have a son? Your son \n",
      "Bharata has equal rights over this kingdom. If Rama becomes the \n",
      "king, then Kaushalaya’s haughtiness will know no bounds. You will \n",
      "be her maid and Bharata will be treated like Rama’s servant. You are \n",
      "supposed to be king Dasharatha’s favourite.But how has he proved \n",
      "it? By making Rama the king and ignoring Bharata totally? Is it fair? \n",
      "“Just think about the future.” \n",
      "“Why should I think about the future?” replied Kaikeyi. “Manthara, \n",
      "Rama is the eldest born. He is virtuous; he is valiant and is \n",
      "thoroughly well-versed in all sciences and all arts. People love him. \n",
      "So do me. Because I love him more than my own son. \n",
      "Manthara would not give up. Speaking in loving tone, she told \n",
      "Kaikeyi “Dear child! I am old enough to know the ways of the world. \n",
      "I can only pity you for your misplaced love towards Rama. Just \n",
      "imagine! What will be the fate of Bharata! And look at your husband \n",
      ".He has taken this decision at a time when Bharatha and Shatrugna \n",
      "away from Ayodhya. The King knows that Lakshmana will be a mere \n",
      "puppet in his hands. Kaikeyi! Don’t be idiotic. If you do not act now, \n",
      "you will be sending Bharatha to exile.\n",
      "9 \n",
      " \n",
      "Provoked by Manthara, Kaikeyi thought about what she said. No, she \n",
      "did not mind Rama being the king. But could she, the favorite wife of \n",
      "Dasahratha, be a slave to Kaushalya? “Never” decided Kaikeyi mind. \n",
      "So she immediately asked Manthara “I agree with you. But how do \n",
      "we prevent Rama from becoming the king?” “Simple” answered \n",
      "Manthara, “Send him to the forest.” \n",
      "“But how?” \n",
      "“Don’t you remember that Dasharatha had agreed to grant you two \n",

      "Ask them now. Dasahratha will come to your chambers  \n",
      "To talk about Rama’s coronation. Show him that you are angry. \n",
      "And demand your two wishes. First of all, demand that Bharatha \n",
      "should be crowned the king. Your second wish should be to banish \n",
      "Rama to the forest for 14 years” \n",
      "Kaikeyi was totally changed. She forgot about Rama’s love for her or \n",
      "that she had looked upon him as her own son. At that moment, \n",
      "Rama appeared to be her enemy, someone who was usurping \n",
      "Bharatha of the kingdom. Filled with hatred and anger, she tore up \n",
      "all the fine clothes she had worn, she pulled out the jewelry and \n",
      "threw them on the floor. And she sat huddled in the corner.  \n",
      "The old king came to Kaikeyi chamber to share his happiness, to tell \n",
      "her about the grand preparations for the coronation. But he was \n",
      "upset when he saw the strewn jewelry and the torn clothes. And \n",
      "when he saw his dear queen in tears he was puzzled. He gently \n",
      "wiped her tears and asked her “o, my precious one! Why are you \n",
      "angry? I love you very dearly. Tell me. Why are you so upset?” \n",
      "Kaikeyi grabbed this opportunity. “Will you grant me the two wishes \n",
      "due to me long ago?” she asked. \n",
      "Have no doubt, dear” said the king. “I swear on Rama that I will \n",
      "keep up my word.” \n",
      "Feeling bold, Kaikeyi demanded ‘’ my first wish is that Bharatha \n",
      "should be crowned the king. To fulfill my second wish, Rama should\n",
      "10 \n",
      " \n",
      "live in the forest like a hermit for fourteen years. Grant me these \n",
      "wishes right now. Otherwise, I will end my life.” \n",
      "King Dasharatha could not believe his own ears. He was horrified \n",
      "that Kaikeyi could be so mean and ruthless. “Are you playing a joke \n",
      "on me “he asked her? \n",
      "“No, I am very serious”, Kaikeyi said, laughing crudely. \n",
      "The king was shocked. He fainted. After a while, he regained his \n",
      "consciousness and pleaded with her “Kaika, give up your wishes. \n",
      "What you ask for is totally unfair. You have always told me that you \n",
      "love Rama as your son. Bharatha has been very devoted to Rama \n",
      "and when he comes to know of your treachery, he will never forgive \n",
      "you. Don’t Kaika, don’t! Give up such dangerous thoughts. I cannot \n",
      "bear to be separated from Rama. Don’t inflict this agony upon me in \n",
      "my old age. If you insist, I will crown Bharatha as the king but \n",
      "please do not banish my Rama to the forest”. King Dasahratha just \n",
      "could not control his emotions and wept bitterly. \n",
      "Kaikeyi was unmoved. She did not want Rama in Ayodhya because \n",
      "she felt that only then Bharatha would be able to gain the love and \n",
      "respect of the people of Ayodhya. So she was adamant. “Keep up \n",
      "your word” she insisted. The king went pale anxiety. Rama was born \n",
      "as a result of yagna and that too, after being childless for a very long \n",
      "time. How could Dasahratha betray such a precious son? Why was \n",
      "Kaikeyi behaving in such a wicked manner? Who provoked her into \n",
      "this? \n",
      "Tormented with these thoughts, the king again tries to change \n",
      "Kaikeyi mind “Kaika, are you angry that I decided on Rama’s \n",
      "coronation without telling you? If so, please forgive me. I beg of \n",
      "you. Agree to this coronation .People will love and respect you for \n",
      "this. \n",
      "Kaikeyi did not budge.Dashratha spent that night in Kaikeyi \n",
      "chamber, pleading with her, begging her and crying for mercy. The \n",
      "morning dawned. The city of Ayodhya wore a gay look. People were \n",
      "getting ready to take part in the coronation ceremony. Vashishta and \n",
      "other sages were busy with rituals. Manthara, the minister, who was\n",
      "11 \n",
      " \n",
      "told that the king was in Kaikeyi chamber, reached the room, only to \n",
      "find the king in a sad state. Kaikeyi stopped him from talking to the \n",
      "king and ordered him “Sumatra, go and fetch Rama here. I want to \n",
      "talk to him.” \n",
      "Sumnathara conveyed this message to Rama and Rama reached \n",
      "Kaikeyi’s chamber immediately. On seeing him, the old king just \n",
      "could not control his tears and cried out “Rama! My dearest son \n",
      "Rama!” \n",
      "“Mother, why is father looking so pale and grief-stricken? Have I \n",
      "caused him any anguish?” asked Rama politely. \n",
      "Kaikeyi told him about her two wishes and about the king’s \n",
      "reluctance to agree to them. \n",
      "Without any hesitation Rama at once agreed to carry out her wishes \n",
      "“Mother, you want me to live in the forest like a hermit. Is that all? I \n",
      "will do anything for you. I will leave to-day itself. Bharatha is my \n",
      "brother. I will be happiest person to see him as the king. I will \n",
      "sacrifice even my life to him.” Rama continued and said in a very \n",
      "calm voice. “For such a minor matter, I do not want to see my dear \n",
      "father unhappy. Please console him and please summon Bharatha to \n",
      "Ayodhya at once.” \n",
      "Kaikeyi was delighted that Rama had agreed to carry out her wishes. \n",
      "“Rama, I will send word to Bharatha. Meanwhile you can leave \n",
      "Ayodhya. \n",
      "On hearing this, Dasahratha cried out once again “Kaika, Kika, don’t \n",
      "be so cruel”. He could not even standup properly. \n",
      "Rama hurried to his father and hugging lovingly told him “Dear \n",
      "father, it is my duty to honour any promise you have made. “He \n",
      "turned towards Kaikeyi “Mother, please allow me a few moments to \n",
      "tell my own mother and my wife Sita”. He touched his parent’s feet \n",
      "in salutation and left the chamber in a very dignified manner. \n",
      "Kaushalya on hearing the news lamented “Rama, my child! How can \n",
      "I live without you? Take me along with you to the forest.” \n",
      "Lakshmana who heard this was enraged. “Why is father banishing\n",
      "12 \n",
      " \n",
      "Rama to the forest? Is she afraid of Bharatha? In that case, I will \n",
      "wipe out Bharatha and his supporters. “he shouted in anger. But \n",
      "Rama Spoke in a calm and firm voice that it was his duty to carry out \n",
      "his father’s promises. Kaushalya felt very sad. Should a prince like \n",
      "Rama live in a forest eating simple food and sleeping on a rough –\n",
      "straw mat? But Rama would not hear of any such argument and so, \n",
      "with a heavy heart, she bid farewell to her dearest son. \n",
      "After taking leave of his mother, Rama went to talk to Sita. As soon \n",
      "as she heard that Bharatha was to be the king and that Rama was to \n",
      "live in the forest, she decided to go with her husband. Rama tried to \n",
      "prevent her by saying “Janaki, don’t worry about me. Please stay \n",
      "back in the palace and take care of my mothers. Treat my brothers \n",
      "well. At the end of the fourteen year of period, I will return safely to \n",
      "Ayodhya. No harm will come to me”. \n",
      "Sita replied “Lord, I will follow you like a shadow. I do not want the \n",
      "comforts of the palace without you. Nothing can give me greater \n",
      "happiness than being with you”. Rama tried his utmost to dissuade \n",
      "her “Wild beasts roam around in the forest. You will not have a soft \n",
      "bed to sleep on. Nor will there be good food to eat. Your tender feet \n",
      "will hurt when you walk on the thorny paths”.  \n",
      "Sita did not lose courage “Aryaputra, How can the beasts attack me \n",
      "when you are there? Without you, even the softest bed will be like a \n",
      "bed of thorns. It is my duty to be with you. Please let me come with \n",
      "you” pleaded Sita softly. So Rama agreed to Sita’s request. \n",
      "Lakshmana, who heard about Rama and Sita’s decision, came \n",
      "running to him, fell at his brother’s feet and begged of him “Please \n",
      "do not leave me behind. I will also come with you to the forest; \n",
      "Ayodhya will be like hell to me without you.” Rama hesitated, for, \n",
      "there was a very strong bond of love and affection between the two \n",
      "of them. But at the same time, why should Lakshmana undergo such \n",
      "exile for the sake of brotherly love, thought of Rama. So he said, \n",
      "“Sowmitri, if you come away with me, who will protect and look \n",
      "after our parents? But Lakshmana refused to stay back “Bharatha \n",
      "will look after our parents, whereas, you will have none with you in \n",
      "the forest.\n",
      "13 \n",
      " \n",
      "I can fetch you fruits and water and look after you and my respected \n",
      "sister-in-law. “So saying, he went to his mother to break the news to \n",
      "her. \n",
      "Sita, Rama and Lakshmana discarded all their royal clothes. All that \n",
      "Rama and Lakshmana carried with them were their bows and \n",
      "arrows. By that time, this sad news had spread like fire all over \n",
      "Ayodhya and people wept at the thought that Rama would not be \n",
      "their king. None could witness the scene of Rama, Sita and \n",
      "Lakshmana walking barefoot, dressed like hermits. Fate is so cruel” \n",
      "thought many. Will these three be able to face the dangers of a \n",
      "forest” was their worry.  \n",
      "As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered Dasharatha’s chamber to \n",
      "offer their final farewell to him. Dasahratha just could not control his \n",
      "anguish. ‘Rama, my dearest son, I wish I was robbed of my eye sight \n",
      "than witness such a cruel scene. Will you ever forgive me, my son?” \n",
      "said Dasharatha. \n",
      "Rama wiped his father’s tears softly, “Father, I am duty bound to \n",
      "fulfill your wish, Please bless us.” \n",
      "Dasahratha realized that he could not make Kaikeyi change her mind \n",
      "nor could he make Rama go back on what he had said. In a \n",
      "trembling voice, he asked Sumantra, the minister, to send the troops \n",
      "and servants along with Rama to the forest. This made Kaikeyi all \n",
      "angrier. ”O King! Is it fair on your part to send the troops away? Do \n",
      "you want my son to rule over an empty Ayodhya? No, no one should \n",
      "go with Rama” she said in a final tone. \n",
      "Utterly defeated, Dashratha ordered that Rama, Sita and Lakshmana \n",
      "be taken by chariot at least till outskirts of Ayodhya. “I cannot bear \n",
      "to see them walking through the streets of Ayodhya.” Since Kaikeyi \n",
      "did not object this, Sumanthara got a chariot readied. \n",
      "Sri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana touched the feet of all their elders to seek \n",
      "their blessings. As Rama, Sita and Lakshmana got into the chariot, \n",
      "the entire population of Ayodhya wept. “How could the king behave \n",
      "so foolishly” ridiculed some, “Will the old parents bear the \n",
      "separation from their dear son” was the anxiety upon many faces.\n",
      "14 \n",
      " \n",
      "The chariot started moving. The king Dasharatha, wanted to have a \n",
      "last look at Rama, seeing this Rama wanted the chariot to move \n",
      "faster but the old king ran behind it crying out Rama’s name. \n",
      "Kaushalya also tried to follow the chariot. People averted their eyes, \n",
      "as they could not withstand such a pitiable scene. Rama’s eyes were \n",
      "filled with tears. As chariot moved faster, Dasharatha collapsed on \n",
      "the street. When Kaikeyi tried to help him, he cried “Don’t ever \n",
      "touch me. I don’t want to see you again. Just go away.” \n",
      "Even when the chariot began to move faster, people followed it. \n",
      "Rama again appealed to them “I know of our enormous love and \n",
      "affection towards me. From now on, Bharatha will be your king. \n",
      "Please show him the same love and affection that you have towards \n",
      "me”. The citizens insisted that they would follow him to the forest. \n",
      "By that time, the chariot had reached the Tamasa river bank. Since \n",
      "they had run behind the chariot for a long distance, they were all \n",
      "tired and soon fell asleep under the trees. Taking advantage of this, \n",
      "Rama ordered Sumanthara to take him to the borders of Kosala \n",
      "country and before dawn, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana had reached \n",
      "the banks of the river Ganga. \n",
      "When the citizens woke up in the morning, they realized that Rama, \n",
      "Sita and Lakshmana were nowhere in the vicinity. They had no other \n",
      "option than to return to Ayodhya. \n",
      "Rama decided to cross the river Ganga and continue their journey. \n",
      "In the nearby forest lived Guha, the king of hunters. He was a friend \n",
      "of Rama and so, he was very happy to see him. Welcoming Rama, \n",
      "Sita and Lakshmana, Guha offered them many delicacies to eat. But \n",
      "Rama refused these saying that since his exile had begun, I would \n",
      "only eat simple food. He stayed there for overnight and slept on the \n",
      "hard floor. He was very worried about his father. So the next \n",
      "morning, he requested Sumanthara to return to Ayodhya and take \n",
      "care of his parents Sumanthara reluctantly agreed to return to \n",
      "Ayodhya on crossing the river. The three travelers bid good bye to \n",
      "Guha and walked through the dense jungle. Lakshmana walked in \n",
      "front, clearing the jungle path, Sita walked in-between and Rama \n",
      "walked behind her. It was not easy, for them to walk bare-foot on \n",
      "the thorny paths. But they walked on cheerfully, admiring the way\n",
      "15 \n",
      " \n",
      "huge trees grew, how the insects collected the food. In the night, \n",
      "they slept on the grassy slopes of a tree and at dawn, started their \n",
      "journey again. On the way, they halted at hermitage of Bharadwaj. \n",
      "Sage Bharadwaj was delighted with his guests and extended a warm \n",
      "hospitality to them. He then suggested that they live in Chitrakut \n",
      "region, which was full of enchanting scenery. \n",
      "Rama, Sita and Lakshmana, followed his advice and reached \n",
      "Chitrakut by crossing the river Yamuna. \n",
      "Rama liked the area very much. So, he decided to live there and \n",
      "asked Lakshmana to set up Parnakuti, a thatched hut. Rama \n",
      "performed rituals and offered prayers to his elders and entered his \n",
      "home. Malyavati River followed nearby. Flowering trees, fruit trees \n",
      "were found to be in plenty. There were so much beautiful butterflies \n",
      "around. The sweet singing of the birds lent an enchantment to the \n",
      "area. Sita loved the place. \n",
      "In the meantime, Sumanthara had returned to Ayodhya. By then, he \n",
      "had received news about Rama, Sita and Lakshmana having reached \n",
      "Chitrkut. Without Rama’s presence, the entire Ayodhya looked like a \n",
      "ghost city. People seemed Disinterested in everything. And when \n",
      "they saw Sumanthara return in an empty chariot, they wept. \n",
      "Sumanthara return to Ayodhya kindled a small hope in Dasharatha. \n",
      "“May be Rama was persuaded to give up his word and return to the \n",
      "kingdom” he thought. “I do not want to live without my Rama’s \n",
      "birth, his childhood and his marriage to Sita.” I have lost such a \n",
      "wonderful son. I do not know what sin I committed.” \n",
      "Then, he suddenly remembered an incident which occurred when he \n",
      "was young. \n",
      "Dasharatha had once gone hunting and had reached Sarayu River. It \n",
      "was a dark night and he heard a sound of splashing in water. He \n",
      "thought that a wild beast had come to drink water and aimed his \n",
      "arrow in the direction from which the sound emanated. When \n",
      "Dasahratha tried to trace his victim, he found that his arrow had hit \n",
      "a young lad by name Sravanakumar. This boy was fetching water for \n",
      "his blind parents. Dasahratha at once picked him in his arms, but by\n",
      "16 \n",
      " \n",
      "the time he took him to the blind parents, the boy was already dead. \n",
      "The grief-stricken father of Sravanakumar cursed Dasahratha “O \n",
      "King! You have killed my son and thus separated me from him. This \n",
      "grief will be the cause of my death. You shall also die, pining for \n",
      "your son. \n",
      "Dasahratha told Kaushalya about this incident and holding her \n",
      "hands, said “The sage’s curse had come true now. Please forgive me \n",
      "for all my sins”.  \n",
      "The king recalled each and every feature of the handsome Rama and \n",
      "with tears blurring his eyes cried out “I wanted my son to be near \n",

      "to my kingdom. Forgot about Rama, who cannot even feed you well \n",

      "hand. But Ravana ignored her warnings and pleas and forcibly \n",
      "dragged her to his Pushpak Viman. Soon he was air-borne. Sita, who \n",
      "was rambling like a fawn cried out “Rama, Rama. Lakshmana. Where \n",
      "are you? The wicked Ravana is taking me away.” But there was no \n",
      "response. So, she made a fervent plea to the trees and the birds to \n",
      "convey the message to Rama that she was in distress. Jatayu, the \n",
      "king of bird, heard her cries. As soon as she saw him, she pleaded \n",

      "worried. To add to his worry, he heard the demon roar and also saw \n",
      "blood flow out of the cave. So he thought that Vali was dead, closed \n",
      "the cave with a huge rock and returned to Kishkinda. Since the \n",

      "Hanuman introduced himself to Rama and told him about Sugriva. In \n",
      "turn, Lakshmana told him about them and said “O Vanara! A \n",

      "where he lives. We are here to ask for Sugriva’s help to know more \n",
      "about Ravana. We are not here to kill Sugriva.” \n",
      "Satisfied with this reply, Hanuman carried Rama and Lakshmana on \n",
      "his shoulders and with a powerful hop, reached the peak where \n",
      "Sugriva lived. \n",
      "Sugriva, on hearing about Rama’s plight, embraced him warmly and \n",

      "is, we will find here. Oh Yes! Now I remember. A few days back, we \n",
      "saw a woman being abducted by a Rakshasa. And we heard her cry \n",
      "“Rama! Lakshmana! Please save me.” She then threw down some of \n",
      "her ornaments tied in a piece of cloth. I will fetch these for you. \n",
      "Please see whether they belong to Mother Sita.” So saying Sugriva \n",
      "asked one of the Vanaras to fetch the ornaments.\n",
      "30 \n",
      " \n",
      "As soon as Rama saw the ornaments, tears welled up in his eyes and \n",
      "crying out Sita’s name, he fainted. After a while he regained \n",
      "consciousness and asked Lakshmana “Brother, please make sure \n",
      "that these belong to Sita”. But Lakshmana could not identify any \n",
      "head ornament or ear ornament. He bowed his head and said “I have \n",
      "never looked at my respected sister-in-law’s face or any other \n",
      "portion of her body. I can only identify the articles worn by her as I \n",
      "have noticed them while touching her feet every day.” Such was the \n",
      "respect Lakshmana had towards his brother’s wife. \n",
      "Rama then looked at the ornaments and knew for certain that they \n",
      "belonged to his dearest wife. He swore “I will kill Ravana who has \n",
      "separated Sita from me”. \n",
      "Sugriva consoled his friend Rama and promised him that he would \n",
      "send the Vanara army to trace Sita and they help in killing Ravana. \n",
      "In return, the grateful Rama offered to kill Vali and help Sugriva in \n",
      "regaining his kingdom. \n",
      "Sugriva who was still not aware of Rama’s enormous skill and \n",
      "bravery was doubtful whether he could fight against the very \n",
      "powerful Vali. \n",
      "“Dear friend” he told Rama “I am glad with your offer to kill Vali. But \n",
      "I know my brother well. I have seen with my own eyes how Vali \n",
      "knocked down a line of seven trees with a single arrow. If you can \n",
      "also prove your skill, I will feel assured.” \n",
      "Upon this, Rama felled seven trees in a line with a single arrow. This \n",
      "made Sugriva very happy. So he went to Kishkinda and challenged \n",
      "Vali to duel. This angered Vali a lot and he accepted Sugriva’s \n",
      "challenge at once. But in no time at all, Sugriva was overpowered by \n",
      "Vali. Just at that time, Rama, who was hiding behind a tree, used an \n",
      "arrow capable of killing Vali. It hit him on the chest and Vali fell to \n",
      "the ground. Stunned by such an unexpected attack Vali looked \n",
      "around and saw Rama. “Rama is it fair on your part to hide behind a \n",
      "tree like a coward and kill me?” accused Vali. He added “You are a \n",
      "righteous man. How could you stoop to such level? And moreover, \n",
      "what grudge do you bear against me? Am I your enemy? Answer me,\n",
      "31 \n",
      " \n",
      "Rama. Without any reason you have killed me. What you have done \n",
      "is wrong?” \n",
      "In reply Rama said “Vali, Sugriva is my friend. In fact, he is like a \n",
      "brother to me. You had forcibly taken away his wife. So I had to kill \n",
      "you. Moreover you are not a human being. You are a Vanara. So I am \n",
      "justified in killing you in a surprise attack.” \n",
      "Vali could not say anything against this argument. So, he took \n",
      "Sugriva’s hand in his own and asked him to look after his own son \n",
      "angada well. In a few moments Vali was dead. \n",
      "Sugriva, who regained the kingdom of Kishkinda, soon forgot all \n",
      "about helping Rama to trace Sita. While Rama and Lakshmana lived \n",
      "in a cave, waiting for Sugriva’s help, Sugriva lived the life of a king, \n",
      "enjoying all the luxuries. This annoyed Lakshmana very much as he \n",
      "could no longer watch his brother pining for Sita. So he immediately \n",
      "rushed to Kishkinda swearing that he would kill Sugriva for breaking \n",
      "his promise. Alarmed at such anger, Hanuman hurried to Sugriva and \n",
      "remained him about his promise to Rama. “Hasn’t Rama proved his \n",
      "friendship to you? Should not you repay his gratitude? He asked. \n",
      "Realising his mistake, Sugriva hastened to Rama and begged for \n",
      "forgiveness. He then ordered Hanuman to summon all the Vanaras to \n",
      "Kishkinda. Soon thousands of Vanaras assembled at Kishkinda and \n",
      "Sugriva instructed them to search for Sita in all the four directions. \n",
      "He separately instructed Hanuman “Maruthi! You are the most \n",
      "capable of all the Vanaras. I am sure that you will bring us the good \n",
      "news very soon.” Rama also agreed with Sugriva. He called \n",
      "Hanuman aside and gave him his ring. “When you meet Sita, please \n",
      "show her this ring. She will then know that you are truly my \n",
      "messenger.” Gunuman accepted the ring with devotion and after \n",
      "touching Rama’s feet in reverence, left on his mission. \n",
      "Sugriva had given one month’s time to the Vanaras to trace Sita. \n",
      "They searched and searched but just could not get any news about \n",
      "her. One group of Vanaras which had gone in the southerly direction \n",
      "under Hanuman’s leadership was also unlucky. Tired and dejected, \n",
      "they sat on the seashore wondering what to do next. None of them\n",
      "32 \n",
      " \n",
      "dared to go to Sugriva for he had warned them not to come back \n",
      "without news about Sita. As they were unsuccessful in their aim, \n",
      "they decided they would rather die. “Yes! Let us end our lives. At \n",
      "least we have the satisfaction that we were in Rama’s service at \n",
      "least for a short time. Wish we could have died like Jatayu, fighting \n",
      "for Sita’s rescue” they said loudly.  \n",
      "At the mention of the name Jatayu, a sea-bird came out from atop \n",
      "the sea boulders and asked the Vanara prince Angada, “Sir! I am \n",
      "Sampati, Jatayu’s elder brother. Did I hear you say that Jatayu was \n",
      "killed by the ten-headed Ravana? I wish I could also have fought \n",
      "against Ravana because I saw him cross the sea along with a \n",
      "beautiful lady. May be she was Sita.” \n",
      "Sampati continued and said “I know where the wicked Ravana lives. \n",
      "It is an island called Lanka which is very far away. Strong walls have \n",
      "been built around the city and it is difficult to cross them unnoticed.” \n",
      "The Vanaras felt happy that at least they knew where Sita was. But \n",
      "at the same time, they wondered how they could possibly cross the \n",
      "vast ocean and reach Lanka. Several of them tried to jump across \n",
      "but only landed on water. They were again disappointed. \n",
      "Jambavanta, an elderly bear-like being advised Anjaneya “Son! You \n",
      "have the speed of wind. You have the strength to destroy an entire \n",
      "city. You are the only one among us who can jump across the ocean \n",
      "and land on Lanka. \n",
      "Enthusiasm welled up in Hanuman. He expanded his chest and \n",
      "sucking in the air, grew bigger and bigger till he seemed to touch the \n",
      "sky. With courage burning in his eyes he proclaimed “I shall fly \n",
      "across to Lanka and return along with Mother Sita.” He then strode \n",
      "atop the tallest peak and with a powerful thrust of his legs, took off. \n",
      "This vibration was so very strong that it rattled the entire hill. Soon \n",
      "he was airborne and looked as if he was the moon traversing across \n",
      "the skies. \n",
      "The Vanara army which watched Hanuman’s feat with wonder \n",
      "danced with joy and blessed this son of Vayu for saving them from \n",
      "humiliation.\n",
      "33 \n",
      " \n",
      "1.9 Hanuman meets Sita- Lanka is destroyed \n",
      "Hanuman was also applauded by Suras who showered flower petals \n",
      "on him. The Sun God silently blessed Hanuman by radiating less of \n",
      "heat. The wind God Vayu turned into a gentle breeze and wished his \n",
      "son success. \n",
      "To test Hanuman’s devotion towards Rama, the Devas sent Surasa, \n",
      "who obstructed Hanuman’s flight. She turned herself into a \n",
      "demoness and opened her mouth wide. Hanuman grew bigger in \n",
      "size. She opened her mouth several miles wide and challenged \n",
      "Hanuman that she would let him pass only if he could enter her \n",
      "mouth. Hanuman at once shrunk his body to the size of thumb and \n",
      "even before Surase could realize what was happening, got in and got \n",
      "out of her mouth. Surase regained her earlier form and wished him \n",
      "well. \n",
      "Hanuman encounters several more obstacles but he overcame all of \n",
      "them. He finally landed on Mount Trikuta on which the city of Lanka \n",
      "had been set up. \n",
      "Lanka city was dazzling city. It had beautiful gardens and parks. The \n",
      "city was surrounded by forts; fierce looking Rakshas kept watch day \n",
      "and night and never let any stranger enter the city. So Hanuman \n",
      "decided to turn into a very tiny being and slip past the guards. Soon, \n",
      "it was dark all over and Hanuman tried to climb over the fort wall \n",
      "and enter Lanka. But he spotted by Lankini, the protector of Lanka \n",
      "and she tried to stamp him with her massive feet. The enraged \n",
      "Hanuman punched her very hard and with blood running out of her \n",
      "nose and ears, Lankini slumped to the ground. He then quickly \n",
      "entered the city. \n",
      "Bearing in mind Rama’s description of Sita, Hanuman searched for \n",
      "her all over Lanka. But everywhere he found only hideous looking \n",
      "Rakshasas. He then peeped into each and every house but could not \n",
      "find Sita. “Ravana might have forced her to stay in the royal \n",
      "chamber. Let me cheek there” thought Hanuman but could not find \n",
      "her there. He closely examined each wife of Ravana including \n",
      "Mandodari but none could match the description of Sita. Hanuman \n",
      "got worried. If he were to go back to Rama empty handed, Rama\n",
      "34 \n",
      " \n",
      "would die. This would lead to Lakshmana’s death too. Unable to bear \n",
      "the news, Bharatha, Shatrugna, Kaushalya ….. and the entire \n",
      "Ayodhya will die mourning for Rama. Sugriva will end his life unable \n",
      "to bear his friend Rama’s death. Hanuman trembled to think of the \n",
      "consequences if he could not find Sita. “Whatever happens, I will not \n",
      "return to Kishkinda unless I have news of Sita” swore Hanuman. \n",
      "Searching for Sita, Hanuman entered the Ashoka garden. With \n",
      "hundreds of trees, the garden looked beautiful. And under a tree sat \n",
      "a beautiful lady. All her clothes were torn and faded. She looked \n",
      "pale. The beautiful lady was surrounded by ugly looking Rakshasis \n",
      "who kept on praising Ravana in front of her. By then, Hanuman \n",
      "recalled seeing Sita when she threw down the ornaments. He felt \n",
      "happy and relieved that Sita was alive. But at the same time he felt \n",
      "sorry for her condition and also felt sad that a person like Sita had to \n",
      "undergo such cruelty. Hanuman decided to talk to her when she was \n",
      "alone. So he climbed the tree above her and hid himself amongst the \n",
      "branches. \n",
      "In a short while, Ravana reached the garden and tried his best to \n",
      "make Sita like him. Hanuman was furious to hear such talk that he \n",
      "wanted to kill Ravana at that very spot. Sita even refused to listen to \n",
      "what Ravana was saying, and closing her ears said in a firm voice “I \n",
      "belong to Rama totally. Rama will definitely come and rescue me. \n",
      "That will be the final day of your life. Get out.” The irritated Ravana \n",
      "ordered the Rakshasis to make Sita change her mind with the \n",
      "exception of kind Rakshasi called Trijata; all the others pestered Sita \n",
      "but in vain. Finally they gave up and went off to sleep. Unable to \n",
      "bear the situation any longer, Sita decided to hang herself from the \n",
      "tree and die. \n",
      "Hanuman who was watching Sita said softly “Rama, Rama,” Sita \n",
      "stopped and looked up. She saw a monkey. She thought that Ravana \n",
      "was up to some magic tricks. Hanuman then talked about what \n",
      "Rama liked and what he did not. Sita’s hand which was about to tie \n",
      "the noose stopped. Hanuman slowly got down from the tree and \n",
      "bowing his head before Sita, introduced himself as Rama’s humble \n",
      "servant. To remove any doubts from her mind, Hanuman showed her \n",
      "the ring sent by Rama. Tears of happiness filled up Sita’s eyes as\n",
      "35 \n",
      " \n",
      "soon as she saw her husband’s ring. She could then believe \n",
      "Hanuman when he told her that Rama would soon be waging a war \n",
      "against Ravana and rescue her from Lanka. She gave Hanuman one \n",
      "of her ornaments and blessed him “Please convey my love to Rama. \n",
      "Let him kill Ravana and rescue me from here very soon. Let there be \n",

      "“O Monkey! Who are you? And why did you destroy the Asoka \n",

      "“Sir” replied Hanuman “I am Rama’s messenger. I came to Lanka in \n",
      "search of Sita. You have committed a great mistake by abducting \n",
      "Sita. If you want to live, you return Sita to Rama gracefully and seek \n",
      "refuge in him. Otherwise you are sure to die”. \n",
      "Having warned Ravana thus, Hanuman added “Listen! I myself could \n",

      "Vibhishana could not tolerate his brother Ravana being provoked to \n",

      "Ravana, his son Indrajit and the Rakshasas thought that Vibhishana \n",
      "was behaving like a coward. Vibhisana’s frank talk was not liked by \n",

      "Under Vibhisana’s guidance, the Vanaras built a bridge across the \n",
      "sea by placing logs of wood and big stones. In a few days the bridge \n",

      "the sea and reached Lanka. \n",
      "As soon as the Vanara army reached the gates of Lanka, Rama \n",
      "divided them into battalions and placed each group at important \n",
      "places. The whole area echoed with the sound of conches being \n",
      "blown and bows being stringed. These sounds created a scare even \n",
      "in the minds of Rakshasas. Each one of the Vanaras fought bravely \n",
      "and injured or killed many Rakshasas. Sugriva, Hanuman, angad, \n",
      "Neel killed many Rakshasas and every time they killed, cried out \n",
      "“Victory to Sri Rama!” \n",
      "The Rakshasas fought equally well. Especially at night, they used \n",
      "their magical powers and were responsible for the death of many \n",
      "Vanaras. But the death toll in Ravenna’s army was very, very high. \n",
      "This upset Ravana very much because he had thought that it was \n",
      "very easy to defeat an army of monkeys. But his son Indrajit swore \n",
      "that Rama and Lakshmana would both be dead before the morning. \n",
      "This filled Ravana with delight. He embraced his son and told him \n",
      "“Indrajit, I am proud of you. May success be yours?” \n",
      "Indrajit used the darkness of the night and waged the war with skill \n",
      "and valor. Many Vanaras died at his hands. Indrajit then employed \n",

      "Lakshmana as snakes. The poison emitted by these snakes made \n",
      "Rama and Lakshmana lose consciousness. Both of them fell to the \n",
      "ground. Taking them to be dead. Indrajit conveyed this good news to \n",
      "his father. Needless to say, Ravana was extremely happy. This news\n",
      "40 \n",
      " \n",
      "was conveyed to Sita and she was brought in flying-machine to show \n",
      "her the fate of her husband and her brother-in-law. She was grief \n",
      "stricken that her dearest husband was dead. \n",
      "Soon, the whole of Lanka was agog with the news that Rama and \n",
      "Lakshmana were found dead in the battle field. But only Vibhishana \n",
      "knew that Rama and Lakshmana had lost consciousness. Soon Rama \n",
      "regained consciousness but Lakshmana had not recovered from the \n",
      "snake poison. His body was slowly turning blue and Rama was \n",
      "extremely worried. The Devas who were watching this from the \n",
      "heaven instructed Garuda* to save Rama and Lakshmana from the \n",
      "snakes. When the snakes saw that Garuda was about to swoop down \n",
      "on them, they unwound themselves and disappeared into snake pits. \n",
      "Rama and Lakshmana soon came back to normal. Garuda warned \n",
      "them to be careful about Indrajit and flew into high skies again. \n",
      "Ravana sent many more Rakshasas, who were very good at fare. But \n",
      "each one of them died at the hands of Hanuman, Neela and other \n",
      "valiant Vanaras. \n",
      "Ravana felt very humiliated. He immediately rushed to Kumbakarna \n",
      "who was fast asleep. With great difficulty, Ravana woke up his \n",
      "brother. \n",
      "“Kumbakarna, if you love me, go and kill my enemies” he ordered. \n",
      "Kumbakarna had to obey his brother. So he got out of his enormous \n",
      "bed and walked towards the battle field. He was so huge and \n",
      "massive; it appeared as if a big mountain had entered the battle \n",
      "field. Kumbakarna lifted Sugriva and Hanuman easily. He thrashed \n",
      "Hanuman on the ground and tucked Sugriva under his arm. But \n",
      "Sugriva managed to escape by leaping high into the sky and stood \n",
      "behind Rama. The enraged Kumbakarna challenged Rama and a \n",
      "fierce battle was waged. Rama used one of his powerful weapons \n",
      "and chopped Kumbakarna’s arms and legs. He used another weapon \n",
      "which separated Kumbakarna’s head from his body. Kumbakarna \n",
      "died. The Vanaras felt very happy at this success. \n",
      "Ravana was shocked to hear about Kumbakarna’s death. Even then, \n",
      "he decided to continue the war. So he sent his sons Devanathaka,\n",
      "41 \n",
      " \n",
      "Naranthaka, Trishiraska and Atikaya to the battle. But they were no \n",
      "match for the Vanaras and soon Ravana received news about their \n",
      "deaths too. \n",
      "Ravana was terribly shaken by these losses. Grief-stricken, he \n",
      "slumped to the ground. Indrajit who saw his father lose courage, \n",
      "tried to instill some confidence in him and said, “Father, As long as I \n",
      "alive please do not think of defeat. This time, my arrows will not \n",
      "spare Rama and Lakshmana. I will soon be back victorious.” \n",
      "Apart from being very brave and very good at warfare, Indrajit also \n",
      "possessed immense magical powers. While his arrows hit Rama and \n",
      "Lakshmana and caused some injuries, he used his magical powers \n",
      "upon the entire Vanara army. This spread a poisonous gas in the air \n",
      "and soon most of the Vanaras tumbled down. Even Rama and \n",
      "Lakshmana were not spared. Jambavantha, who was fighting at the \n",
      "other end quickly called Hanuman and told him “Maruthi, you cross \n",
      "the ocean, go to Kailsh mountain and from there fetch a rare herb \n",
      "called Sanjivini. We can then bring back all the Vanaras to life. But \n",
      "be very quick.” Even before Jambavantha finished saying this, \n",
      "Hanuman flew across with the speed of wind and since he could not \n",
      "find Sanjivini, transported the entire mountain to Lanka. Very soon, \n",
      "Rama, Lakshmana and the Vanaras were up on their feet, fit and \n",
      "fighting. \n",
      "Indrajit once again used his magical powers and turned a Rakshasi \n",
      "to look exactly like Sita. He then took this fake Sita to the battle-\n",
      "field and full view of Rama, Lakshmana, Hanuman, Sugriva and \n",
      "others, severed her head. \n",
      "The Vanaras were aghast. Rama turned numb with shock and \n",
      "Lakshmana vowed to kill Indrajit then and there. He chased Indrajit \n",
      "to a temple where Indrajit acquired more secret powers. Lakshmana \n",
      "destroyed this secret power by using a suitable weapon and also \n",
      "struck down Inderjit’s head. \n",
      "The Vanaras rejoiced at this triumph. Rama felt very relieved that \n",
      "Lakshmana had come to no harm and also that it was not Sita who \n",
      "died at Inderjit’s hands.\n",
      "42 \n",
      " \n",
      "Inderjit’s death was the severest blow to Ravana. He had lost all his \n",
      "sons, his brothers and his army in the war. The whole of Lanka \n",
      "plunged into sorrow. Some criticized Surpanaka for provoking \n",
      "Ravana into kidnapping Sita. Others cursed Ravana for his misdeed \n",
      "“His lust for a woman has caused us so much agony” lamented the \n",
      "citizens for; there was death and destruction in each and every \n",
      "house in Lanka. \n",
      "Ravana climbed into his chariot and entered the battle field with a \n",
      "fierce determination to kill Rama. But first of all, he had to encounter \n",
      "Lakshmana. Ravana stopped the arrows used by Lakshmana in mid-\n",
      "air. He then turned his attention towards Rama. Severe fighting \n",
      "broke out between Rama and Ravana. Ravana used many powerful \n",
      "arrows but Rama could stop each one of them in mid-air. The arrows \n",
      "would become useless and fall down. But then, even Rama’s arrows \n",
      "were futile as they could not penetrate the armor worn by Ravana. \n",
      "This was an armor granted to Ravana by Brahma as a boon and \n",
      "ordinary arrows could not penetrate through it.  \n",
      "With Ravana and Rama both equally powerful, the battle between \n",
      "them was very fierce and raged on for several days. Even the \n",
      "celestial gods watched them anxiously as the war did not seem to \n",
      "end at all. But slowly Ravana felt drained of energy and knew that \n",
      "his end was close at hand. Still he fought. Finally Rama used \n",
      "Brahmastra, the mightiest of all mighty weapons. It tore the armor \n",
      "worn by Ravana and hit him in the chest. The mighty Ravana fell \n",
      "down and died. The evil was vanquished.  \n",
      "The Devas rejoiced over the death of this wicked Rakshasa. The \n",

      "On Rama’s advice, Vibhishana performed Ravenna’s last rites. \n",

      "Sri Rama then sent Hanuman to fetch Sita. Sitadevi was very happy \n",
      "that at least the wicked Ravana had been killed. She looked forward \n",
      "to rejoin her beloved Rama. But he did not accept her immediately. \n",
      "He wanted to test whether she had remained devout to him. So he \n",
      "said “I find it impossible to believe that a womanizer like Ravana \n",
      "had not touched a beautiful woman like you. You are impure, So, I \n",
      "cannot accept you back as my wife.” Rama’s cruel words filled Sita’s \n",
      "heart with sadness. She had given up food and water and had barely \n",
      "kept herself alive only to reunite with Rama. If he suspected her \n",
      "virtue, then life was not worth living for her. So, the distressed Sita \n",
      "turned towards Lakshmana and asked him to prepare a pyre for her. \n",
      "Rama did not object. \n",
      "Sita jumped into the pyre and prayed to Agni, the god of fire to \n",
      "rescue her only if she had remained pure. Kubera, Yama, Varuna, \n",
      "Indra Shiva, Brahma and other gods and goddesses who witnessed \n",
      "this scene from the sky, came down to earth and conveyed their \n",

      "How could you behave like a mere human being? How could you \n",
      "watch Sita jump into the fire?” they asked him. Brahma placed his \n",
      "hand on Rama’s shoulder and told him “You are Narayana. Sita is \n",
      "Lakshmi. As a divine couple, you are far above suspicious and \n",
      "distrust.” By then, Agni gently carried Sita out of the pyre and told \n",
      "Rama “Ramachandra, Sita is chaste. Please accept her”. Rama’s \n",
      "doubts were cleared and joyfully he accepted Sita. \n",
